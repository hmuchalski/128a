## HyFlex Learning

This course is taught in a HyFlex format which combines face-to-face (F2F) and online learning. Some students in the class will learn inside the physical classroom and other students will connect remotely and synchronously using Zoom when needed. Whether remote or in the classroom, students will benefit from the same live synchronous learning session. The goal of HyFlex is to provide a flexible and seamless engagement for the classroom experience responsive to student needs  as well as campus, local, state, and federal guidelines. You initially registered for this class in person and should expect to attend each class session in the assigned classroom. If you cannot attend in person let me know and arrange to connect via Zoom.

# Start here

Welcome to the first semester of course in organic chemistry (CHEM 128A)! I'm Hubert Muchalski, Associate Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Before reading any further, I'd like you to know that:

1. **I want you to be successful in this course.** I will do my utmost to help you do this, by creating and maintaining a learning environment based on challenge and support. "Success" in the course is more than your performance on tests. It means that you are being challenged to grow as a learner, that you are engaging actively with tasks that feed your growth, and that you are doing your best work by solving challenging organic chemistry problems. I also hope that you are here to build your lifelong learning skills so that once the course is over, you are better and stronger as a learner and can continue to learn new things independently.
2. **College-level organic chemistry is more than just memorizing structures and reactions**. You will be asked to do more than just give answers to problems. Your task is to seek deep understanding of underlying concepts and develop an array of skills such as predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions and properties of organic molecules.
3. **Expect to be challenged intellectually throughout this course.** None of these elements of success come easily. They require a great deal of time and attention to properly deal with ambiguity of the concepts and tasks in the course. This will require you to leave your comfort zones on a regular basis. You will need to stay engaged by participating in class meetings and on the class discussions. Students who succeed in this course have few things in common: they ask questions, seek understanding (not answers), form study groups, and help others learn.
4. **Intellectual struggle is normal and healthy in a challenging course.** You can expect at times to feel like you are really struggling with the material, even if learning in earlier chemistry courses came easy. This is a normal and healthy experience. Legitimate struggle is actually a sign you are doing things right---training your mind beyond what it is capable at the moment. My goal is to support you in this process.
5. **You have a lot of help available to you as you work.** You are not expected to do this all on your own. There is a lot of support to help you rise to the challenge. I will do my best to be available for consultations during office hours. You're not alone in this so please engage with your classmates, ask questions, seek clarification and provide help whenever you can.

# Introduction

Carbon-based molecules are central to a host of chemical and biological processes because of their broad range of structure and reactivity. The millions of organic compounds alone, ranging from polymers to pharmaceuticals, make the field important for study. Yet organic chemistry is also a highly integrated discipline that impacts and is impacted by the other branches of chemistry and other sciences. Indeed organic chemistry enables a molecular understanding of physicochemical phenomena in materials science, the environment, biology, and medicine. Because the field has reached a high level of integration with these areas, progress in organic chemistry continues at a fast pace and much more remains to be discovered.

# Course goals and objectives

The goal of this course is to drive the student to appreciate the breadth of organic chemistry by facilitating an understanding of the principles, and the practice of applying them, to gain a working knowledge and appreciation of organic structure and reactivity. As much as this is true, this explanation is vague and doesn't answer a key question: "Why should you, the student, study organic chemistry?"

## Why study organic chemistry?

"To be an organic chemist, or course!" one might say. The fact is, that approximately 1% of all students whom I taught this course are chemists or pursue a graduate degree in organic chemistry. For most students this course is just a part of the curriculum or a requirement for an advanced training program in health-related field. Why, you may wonder, is this course a hard requirement? **Successful completion of organic chemistry is a signal to the outside world.** It demonstrates your competence in self-regulated learning. It shows that you can quickly learn hard abstract concepts and that you know how to work with models and theories. Doing well in organic chemistry also reveals that you can manage time and tasks, and that you can use highly technical language to communicate with peers.

## Course learning objectives (How)

To get closer to achieving course goal, we will focus on a variety of skills. At the successful completion of this course you will be able to:

- use common drawing and naming conventions to communicate the structure and properties of organic molecules;
- analyze chemical structures and reactions to make and defend predictions about chemical processes;
- use curved arrow notation to draw mechanisms of chemical transformations;
- propose a synthesis of an organic molecule; and
- connect the ideas of organic chemistry with your own personal and professional interests.

## Course content (What)   

To achieve course-level objectives we need material to work with. Topics in this course will be focused on the principles of bonding, structure, reactivity, and synthesis of organic molecules and materials. Lectures and problems will often feature organic compounds and reactions in the context of biology, pharmacy, medicine, materials, and energy science. The second semester in the sequence also emphasizes that our only way to molecular knowledge is through experimentation; correlating structure with reactivity and function through wet chemical methods, spectroscopy, and use of computational simulations.

# Structure of the course

I designed this course according to the flipped learning model, an instructional philosophy optimized for active learning. Direct instruction is done before class meetings through structured activities and class time is repurposed for collaborative work on creative applications. This [video series](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8484250) highlights the basics of flipped learning.

**Before class**, your task will be to review previously covered material, and get familiar with the basic concepts. Not all new material needs formal instruction. Information is abundant and you can learn the basics on your own. I will provide a list of suggested reading and video content for you to review before the lesson.

**Class time** will be structured around agile lesson plans that aim to operate within middle third of [Bloom taxonomy](https://flic.kr/p/LQuqT2). There may be some small lectures or tutorials, but active work will be the main component since the best way to learn organic chemistry is by doing lots of problems. It is in your best interest to come class meetings but if circumstances arise, you will have an option to review the recorded Zoom session.

**After class** you should continue to engage with the material through practice and deliberation on the ideas discussed in class until you think you're ready to demonstrate your knowledge by attempting Learning Target problems on Checkpoints.

# Required materials and technology

- **Textbook:** "Organic Chemistry" online textbook by David Klein 4th edition published by Wiley (via Immediate Access[^immediate-access]). This is 1-semester access to e-textbook and WileyPLUS platform. I was told by the publisher that there is an option to purchase paper copy in addition to e-textbook. Consider this option if you think you'll need access to the textbook after you're done with the course (MCAT/DAT prep etc.). Contact the bookstore for details.
- **WileyPLUS:** Online learning platform and homework. WileyPLUS is integrated with Canvas and all links to assignments and materials will be posted on Canvas. [^WileyPLUS-version]
- **A personal computer**: running Windows or macOS, that can run desktop applications and has a reliable access to high-speed internet. A tablet device is an acceptable alternative, but the online homework platform is not optimized for mobile devices.
- **A modern web browser**: Chrome is the recommended browser by Fresno State IT. Other browsers such as Edge, Firefox, or Safari are likely to work just as well but the support will be limited.
- **Document scanning tool**: Many assignments in this course are designed to be prepared by hand on paper. Few people own document scanners nowadays, but a mobile device with a scanning app can do a sufficient job at converting paper documents into PDFs. There are number of options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that you like and learn how to use it.
  [https://fresnostate.instructure.com](https://fresnostate.instructure.com).
- **Zoom:** The broadcast of the class meeting will be held via Zoom. Links and passwords to zoom meetings will be published on Canvas. Make sure your Zoom client is up to date. All Zoom recordings will be published on Panopto.
- **Active Fresno State network account** so that you can access email, Canvas, and Google Suite. If you have any issue with accessing any of the above, please let me know as soon as possible. We will use a variety of additional course tools during the semester, but they will be free to use, and you will be taught how to use them as part of the class.
- **Student response system:** Each student will need an _i>clicker2_ remote or access to the iClicker Reef mobile app. The officially supported model is _i>clicker2_ (available at the Bookstore). [^iclicker-registration]
- **Study Guide and Solutions Manual** This is optional item that you can purchase for additional fee ($15) via IA. It contains solutions to all problems in the textbook.

[^immediate-access]: This course is part of the Immediate Access program. All students have access to a digital version of the textbook and associated materials on the first day of class. Students who wish to purchase course materials on their own can opt-out before their account is automatically charged on the 10th day (5th day for Summer courses) of instruction. Contact the Kennel Bookstore for more details.

[^WileyPLUS-version]: WileyPLUS version must be the same as the official edition of the textbook (4th ed.). If you opt out of Immediate Access and buy the textbook and access to WileyPLUS through other means, make sure that your access code is for the 4th edition of the textbook.

[^iclicker-registration]: You can borrow hardware remote from a friend or buy a used one. Remotes need to be registered online to be linked to your name.

# Types of graded work

You will be engaging with several kinds of activities in the course, both to facilitate learning of the material and to demonstrate how well you have learned it. The course uses a *mastery-based grading system* in which your work will be required to meet certain levels of quality that demonstrate *mastery*. These include:

1. **Learning Targets** are main skills and tasks you should be able to do if you're successfully learning in CHEM 128B. There are **16** Learning Targets in the course (see [Appendix B](#LT)). Your primary goal is to provide evidence of mastery on as many targets as possible. You will do that through *Checkpoints*, asynchronous at-home exams. See ["How work is graded in CHEM 128A"](#grading) below for details.
2. **Application/Extension Problems (AEPs)** are challenging integrated homework problems where students must clearly communicate a complete solution. AEPs measure student skills across multiple learning objectives, will require a formal writeup, and may require additional technology. Submission and grading of AEPs is discussed in ["How work is graded in CHEM 128A"](#grading) section below.
3. **Class Preps** are short quizzes on WileyPLUS to get a sense of how much you learned on your own from reading and watching videos. Additional purpose of this assignment is to provide me with information about issues that the class is having, prior to class meetings. You get credit for the Prep assignment if you complete it before the deadline and if each item has a response that represents a good faith effort to be right. Remember, _mistakes are not penalized_.
4. **Participation** Taking part in student response polls in class (iClicker). You will receive one participation credit if you answer 75% of questions in class session. Correctness is not factored into the score, only participation.
5. **Online Homework (WileyPLUS)** will help you identify knowledge gaps in each chapter. This is an adaptive assignment which means that the set of questions is tailored to your knowledge. The number of questions in the set varies depending how well you know the material. As your answer questions, the progress bar tracks completion. It can increase and decrease based on how you’re doing and you earn points for reaching benchmarks on the Progress bar. You’ll keep your points even if your Progress decreases. Work toward 100% Progress to complete your assignment and show that you know your stuff.
6. **Final exam** will be on **Wednesday, December 15th, 2021 at 15:30**. The final exam is composed of 70 multiple choice questions designed by experts from the American Chemical Society.

## How student work is graded {#grading}

### Checkpoints

One of your primary responsibilities in the course is to demonstrate as much skill as possible on as many Learning Targets as possible through doing "acceptable" work on *Checkpoints*. Checkpoints are timed do-at-home exams offered every 10--14 days (see schedule at the end of syllabus). You will have a 24-hour window of time during which a packet of problems will be available on Canvas for download. You will have 2 hours, from the moment you download the document, to submit your work. Checkpoints contain one problem (often with multiple parts) per Learning Target. Each problem is graded separately and has its own criteria for acceptable work.

Your skill on is indicated in the gradebook separately for each Learning Target using a 3-level rubric:

- **No Rating** indicates that that you did not attempt the learning target or the attempt was unsuccessful. Everyone begins the semester with "No Rating" on all Learning Targets.
- **Proficiency** indicates you completed **one** Checkpoint problem on a Learning Target and the solution met the standards for acceptable work.
- **Mastery** indicates you completed **a second** Checkpoint problem on a Learning Target and the solution met the standards for acceptable work.

**Every Checkpoint is cumulative**, with new Learning Targets represented but also new versions of older ones. This will allow you to reattempt, on a limited basis, any Learning Target you haven't mastered.

### AEPs

AEP assignments are like homework, they are not timed but they have deadlines (4 weeks from when they become available). Your work on Application/Extension Problems (AEPs) is scored similarly to Learning Target problems (pass/no pass) and can be revised and resubmitted (with some limitations described below).

## Revisions and reassessment {#revisions}

You can reattempt Learning Target problems which you did not master yet at a later *Checkpoint*. AEPs can be revised and resubmitted at any time before the deadline and they will be regraded using the same standards as originally used. _Only one AEP submission can may be made per week_. This can be one new submission, or one revision. A second submission can be purchased with a [token](#tokens) (below) but three or more submissions in a week are not allowed under any circumstance.

## Tokens {#tokens}

Every student starts with five tokens, a fake currency which can be spent to purchase exceptions to course policies: a) submission of second AEP (either revision or new submission) in a given week; or 1-hour extension of checkpoint upload time window. Tokens may not be "stacked". For example, you cannot spend 3 tokens to get a 3-hour extension on *Checkpoint* submission deadline.

# Final letter grade

The mastery-based grading system insists that you show consistent excellence in all assignments in the course. Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to earn a particular letter grade, each requirement must be met in the column for that grade, meaning you will earn **the highest grade for which _all_ the requirements are met**. Numerical values in the table indicate the minimum level needed to meet the requirement; amounts above this level also meet the requirement.

| Category           | D  | C  | B  | A   |
|--------------------|----|----|----|-----|
| LTs Mastered       |  6 |  9 | 12 | 15  |
| AEP passed         |    |  2 |  5 |  8  |
| Class Preps        | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25  |
| iClicker Credits   |  5 | 10 | 15 | 20  |
| WileyPLUS Homework | 70 | 80 | 90 | 100 |
| Final Exam score   | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42  |

There are no statistical or numerical adjustments (a.k.a. grading on a curve). Outstanding work in one category, on AEPs for example, does not compensate for poor work in another category. Failing grade (F) is given if not all the requirements for a "D" are met.

Read the example on the next page and referring back to the table above try to determine the final letter grade.

### Example

At the end of the semester Stanley showed mastery on 14 LTs, passed 9 AEPs, did all Class Preps, collected 25 iClicker credits, 120 points on Homework and scored 47 on the final exam.[^7659a235]

[^7659a235]: Stanley will receive "B" in the course, because Stanley did not meet all requirements for A (minimum 15 LTs mastered). Exceeding requirements in other categories is irrelevant.

# Course policies

## Technology issues when submitting work

It is the student’s responsibility to make sure these items are submitted on time, even if technology issues arise. Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try again later, use different browser, upload to Google Drive and share a private link or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.

## Academic integrity

Academic dishonesty carries with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State policies, including possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the university. Details are described in Academic Policy Manual 235 which you can read here: [http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf](http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf). __Every student has the responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest activities.__

Some of the work you will do in the course involves collaboration; at other times collaboration may be allowed but not required; while at others it may not be allowed. Here are the rules for collaboration on each kind of work you do:

+ *Class Prep*, *WileyPLUS Homework*: You may collaborate with others, but your writeup must be your own. You may not copy someone's work and submit it as your own, nor may you copy the ideas from someone and simply change how it's presented (or change wording).
+ *Checkpoints*, *AEPs*, and *ACS exam*: No interactions at all with another person or with unauthorized sources on the internet is allowed. Any evidence of using information from another person or source will be investigated as academic dishonesty.

### Resources you can and cannot use when submitting graded work

Here are the approved resources you can access on all _Checkpoints_ and _AEPs_:

* the textbook;
* video or document posted on Canvas site for this courses (but not other courses);
* slides, class meeting notes, and other materials generated during class time; and
* class zoom recordings.

**Any resource NOT included on this list is to be considered off-limits and not approved for use on Checkpoints. Evidence of using unapproved resources will be considered academic dishonesty.** This includes:

- solution websites such as Chegg;
- other students in the class, or past students from other CHEM 128 classes; and
- other textbooks or videos not included above.

All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be thoroughly investigated, and whether a student has committed academic dishonesty is my determination to make based on the evidence. If I determine academic dishonesty has been committed, a report will be filed with the Dean of Students office, and the minimum penalty will be:

- "no pass" grade on a checkpoint and no possibility for retake;
- "no pass" on AEP assignment and no possibility for revision; and
- point deduction on final ACS exam.

## Deadlines and late work

Deadlines for course work are clearly indicated on the Course Calendar; in cases of apparent conflict between dates, always assume that the Course Calendar is right.

+ *Class Prep* and *WileyPLUS Homework*: No extensions to deadlines are available. Simply submit a good faith effort on all items by the deadline.
+ *Checkpoints*: Submission window may be extended by spending a token. No other extensions are available.
+ *AEPs* will be active for submission for (re)assessment for 4 weeks. You simply submit your work when it is ready to be graded (subject to weekly limits). This deadline will not be extended.

## Intellectual Property

As part of your participation in virtual/online instruction, please remember that the same student conduct rules that are used for in-person classrooms instruction also apply for virtual/online classrooms. Students are prohibited from any unauthorized recording, dissemination, or publication of any academic presentation, including any online classroom instruction, for any commercial purpose. In addition, students may not record or use virtual/online instruction in any manner that would violate copyright law. Students are to use all online/virtual instruction exclusively for the educational purpose of the online class in which the instruction is being provided. Students may not re-record any online recordings or post any online recordings on any other format (e.g., electronic, video, social media, audio recording, web page, internet, hard paper copy, etc.) for any purpose without the explicit written permission of the faculty member providing the instruction. Exceptions for disability-related accommodations will be addressed by Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) working in conjunction with the student and faculty member.

## Dropping the course

Dates and details on withdrawing from courses are described on the [Admissions web pages](http://fresnostate.edu/studentaffairs/are/registration/add-drop-deadlines.html).

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition. Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious and compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.

## Changes to this syllabus

Changes to this syllabus may occur during the term. In those cases, the changes will be announced in class and online, and if appropriate, students will be given a voice on how the changes will be implemented. It is your responsibility stay current on the information passed along in course announcements and any changes that take place.

## Credits

Large portions of the language of this syllabus as well as ideas related to mastery grading and flipped learning were adapted from the syllabi of [Prof. Robert Talbert](https://hackmd.io/@rtalbert235) (Grand Valley University).

# University policies and disclaimers

In addition to course policies, you are expected to be familiar with Academic Regulations described in the [University Catalog](http://www.fresnostate.edu/catalog/academic-regulations/) as well as policies listed below.
