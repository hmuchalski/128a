Grade **A** in this class means that by the end of the semester you demonstrated that you can mastered all of the basic concepts and essential skills of organic chemistry. You developed these those skills further and regularly demonstrated their application in new contexts by solving integrated and challenging problems. I will be very surprised if you are not successful in CHEM 128B and beyond. More specifically it means:

- Mastery of all Core Learning Targets without significant delay
- Mastery of the vast majority of remaining Learning Targets
- Significant evidence of ability to apply basic concepts and skills in new contexts (integrated problems, class journals)
- Strong mechanism reading and writing skills 

**C** letter grade in this course means that by the end of the semester you demonstrated that you have a solid grasp of most but not all basic concepts and essential skills of organic chemistry. You did not, however, develop these skills to a point where you can demonstrate application of these concepts and skills in new contexts or by solving integrated and challenging problems. Success in the subsequent course (CHEM 128B) is possible but not guaranteed. Specifically, it means

- Mastery of almost all Core Learning Targets

+ Links to all important documents and information can be found on the course Canvas site.
+ Once the syllabus is finalized, it will be available in electronic form (here) and as a PDF. After that, the electronic version will be updated as needed, with updates ==highlighted in yellow like this==. *The PDF version will only be updated occasionally and you should use it only for archival purposes.*

## Introduction

In Organic Chemistry 1 you will learn about structure, properties, and reactivity of organic compounds. Carbon-based molecules are central to a host of chemical and biological processes because of their broad range of structure and reactivity. The billions of organic compounds alone, ranging from polymers to pharmaceuticals, make the field important for study. Yet, organic chemistry is also a highly integrated discipline that impacts and is impacted by the other branches of chemistry and other sciences, because **organic chemistry enables a molecular understanding of physicochemical phenomena in materials science, the environment, biology, and medicine**. Because the field has reached a high level of integration with these areas, progress in organic chemistry continues at a fast pace and much more remains to be discovered.

Before reading any further, here are some things to know:

1. **The pace of this course is fast**. We will cover approximately one chapter per week and there is a lot of material introduced in each chapter. New chapters build on the content introduced in prior chapters. To reduce the risk of falling behind, start working on assignments immediaterly,check announcements, ask questions and resists the urge to procrastinate.
2. **College-level chemistry is more than just memorizing structures and reactions**. You will be asked to do more than just give answers to problems. Your goal should be to seek deep understanding of underlying concepts because they are universal and the list is much shorter than a disconnected list of reactions and reagents.
3. **Make sure you understand the grading system.** It is definitely different from what you experienced in the past.
4. **Expect to be challenged intellectually throughout this course.** Nothing of true value comes easily and requires a great deal of time and attention. There will be a good deal with ambiguity of the concepts and tasks in the course. This will require you to leave your comfort zones on a regular basis and challenge your current understanding of chemistry.
5. **Your success in the course depends on your willingness to be actively engaged during class time**. We will spend most of the in-class time practicing the skills related to learning targets. Students who approach the class with a passive mindset typically struggle, and often fail. Those who approach it with growth mindset, on the other hand, often surprise themselves with how much and how well they learn. You will need to stay engaged by participating in class meetings and on the class discussions. Students who succeed in this course have few things in common: they ask questions, seek understanding (not answers), form study groups, and help others learn.
6. **Asking questions is a not a sign of weakness**. It is guaranteed that you will be confused, lost, and stuck every day we meet in class. **That's a good sign!** Asking and answering questions requires you to leave your comfort zones on a regular basis, but is a crucial ingredient in learning. 

:::info
**My #1 job as the professor is to make sure you succeed in learning.** Success in the course doesn't come cheap. Learning hard things involves hard work, a willingness to try things that might not work the first time, and the ability to improve using feedback. But I promise you that I will work to make CHEM 128A a class where you can make mistakes and grow safely and productively.

## Course materials and technology

**Textbook:** "Organic Chemistry" online textbook with integrated Study Guide and Solutions Manual by David Klein 4th edition published by Wiley (via Immediate Access). It is okay to use prior editions of the textbook but you will not have the access to the WileyPLUS platform.

**WileyPLUS:** Online learning platform with e-textbook, practice problems, videos, etc. WileyPLUS is integrated with Canvas and all links to assignments and materials will be posted on Canvas.

:::info 
This course is part of the *Immediate Access program*. All students have access to a digital version of the textbook and associated materials on the first day of class. Students who wish to purchase course materials on their own can opt-out before their account is automatically charged on the 10th day (5th day for Summer courses) of instruction. Contact the Kennel Bookstore for more details.
:::

**A personal computer**: running Windows or macOS, that can run desktop applications and has a reliable access to high-speed internet. A tablet device may work as well but the online homework platform may not work well on mobile devices. Chrome is the recommended browser by Fresno State IT. Other browsers such as Edge, Firefox, or Safari are likely to work just as well but the support will be limited.

**Student response system:** Most students use iClicker Reef mobile app but a physical remote (_i>clicker2_) will also work. Make sure you use your university email when signing up for iClicker service or registering the physical remote. 

**Canvas:** The central repository for all course materials and information found here: [https://fresnostate.instructure.com](https://fresnostate.instructure.com).

**Document scanning tool or a tablet with pen imput**: Some assignments in this course are handwritten on paper and then uploaded to Canvas as PDF files. A mobile device with a scanning app can do a sufficient job at converting paper documents into PDFs. There are number of options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that you like and learn how to use it.

**Active Fresno State network account** so that you can access email, Canvas, and Google Suite. If you have any issue with accessing any of the above, please let me know as soon as possible. We will use a variety of additional course tools during the semester, but they will be free to use, and you will be taught how to use them as part of the class.

## About the course

The goal of this course is to drive the student to appreciate the breadth of organic chemistry by facilitating an understanding of the principles, and the practice of applying them, to gain a working knowledge and appreciation of organic structure and reactivity. As much as this is true, this explanation is vague and doesn't answer a key question: "Why should you, the student, study organic chemistry?"

### Why study organic chemistry?

"To be an organic chemist, or course!" one might say. The fact is, that approximately 1% of all students whom I taught this course are working as chemists or pursue a graduate degree in the physical sciences. For most students this course is just a part of the curriculum or a requirement for an advanced training program in health-related field. Why, you may wonder, is this course a hard requirement? Successful completion of organic chemistry is [a signal to the outside world](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Economics/Principles_of_Microeconomics_(Curtis_and_Irvine)/05%3A_The_Factors_of_Production/13%3A_Human_capital_and_the_income_distribution/13.04%3A_Education_as_signalling). It demonstrates your competence in self-regulated learning, proving that you can quickly learn hard abstract concepts and that you know how to work with models and theories. Doing well in organic chemistry also reveals that you can manage time and tasks, and that you can use highly technical language to communicate with peers. 

### Course learning objectives

To get closer to achieving course goal, we will focus on a variety of skills. At the successful completion of this course you will be able to:

- use common drawing and naming conventions to communicate the structure and properties of organic molecules;
- analyze chemical structures and reactions to make and defend predictions about chemical processes;
- use curved arrow notation to draw mechanisms of chemical transformations;
- propose a synthesis of an organic molecule; and
- connect the ideas of organic chemistry with your own personal and professional interests.

### Course content

To achieve course-level objectives we need material to work with. Topics in this course will be focused on the principles of bonding, structure, reactivity, and synthesis of organic molecules and materials. Lectures and problems will often feature organic compounds and reactions in the context of biology, pharmacy, medicine, materials, and energy science. The second semester in the sequence also emphasizes that our only way to molecular knowledge is through experimentation; correlating structure with reactivity and function through wet chemical methods, spectroscopy, and use of computational simulations.

### Course workflow

I designed this course according to the flipped learning model, an instructional philosophy optimized for active learning. Direct instruction is done before class meetings through structured activities (reading assignments, lecture videos) and class time is focused for collaborative work and practice. This [video series](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8484250) highlights the basics of flipped learning.

**Before class**, your task will be to review previously covered material, and get familiar with the basic concepts. Not all new material needs formal instruction. Information is abundant and you can learn the basics on your own. I will provide a list of suggested reading and video content for you to review before the lesson.

**Class time** will be structured around agile lesson plans that aim to operate within middle third of [Bloom taxonomy](https://flic.kr/p/LQuqT2). There may be some small lectures or tutorials, but active work will be the main component since the best way to learn organic chemistry is by doing lots of problems. 

**After class** you should continue to engage with the material through practice and deliberation on the ideas discussed in class. The goal of these activities is to prepare you to attempt Learning Target problems on Checkpoints and work on Class Journal entries.

## Learning activities and assessments

You will be engaging with several kinds of activities in the course, both to facilitate learning of the material and to demonstrate how well you have learned it. These include:

1. **Learning Targets** are main skills and tasks you should be able to do if you're successfully learning in CHEM 128A. There are **15** Learning Targets in the course (see [Appendix A](#LT)). Your primary goal is to provide evidence of learning on as many targets as possible by solving LT problems during  *Checkpoints*.. 
3. **Class Primers** are weekly assignments on WileyPLUS designed to give you a sense of how much you learned on your own from reading and watching videos. Aggregate results for the entire class highlight points of confusion. You get credit for the assignment if you complete it before the deadline and move the *Progress Bar* above 50%. 
2. **Class Journal** are challenging integrated homework problems where students must clearly communicate a complete solution. Journal entries measure student skills across multiple learning objectives, will require a formal writeup, and may require additional technology. 
4. **iClicker Credits** are earned by taking part in student response polls in class (iClicker Reef). You will receive one participation credit if you answer 75% of questions asked in class session. Correctness is not factored into the score, only participation.
5. **Online Homework (WileyPLUS)** will help you identify knowledge gaps through adaptive online assignments similar to Class Primers. The number and difficulty of questions in the set varies depending how well you know the material. As your answer questions, the progress bar tracks completion. It can increase and decrease based on how you're doing and you earn points for reaching benchmarks on the Progress Bar. You'll keep your points even if your progress decreases. Work toward 100% Progress to complete your assignment and show that you know your stuff.
6. **Final exam** will be on **Wednesday, May 17th, 2023 at 15:30**. The final exam is composed of 70 multiple choice questions designed by education experts from the American Chemical Society. Exam time is 110 minutes. 

:::warning
Grading in this course is different than you might be used to. Make sure you understand it completely. Read the next section carefully and ask questions as needed. 
:::


## Assessments and grading

The course uses a *growth grading system* in which your work will be required to meet certain levels of quality that demonstrate mastery of the material.

### My views on grading

As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that *learning takes time* and that grading your work based on a single point of data, such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps unethical. A truly valid measure of learning has to involve *multiple attempts* that allow you to learn from your past mistakes and demonstrate not only your skill, but also your growth. I believe you should not be penalized for having a bad day that results in a bad test score, so long as you can show evidence that you've *eventually* learned what you need to learn. Course learning objectives are phrased as "at the end of the course the student should be able to…". Thus, nothing is final until the end of the course. 

I also strongly believe that *assigning points to your work is deeply unhelpful* for all parties involved. Points give the appearance of a scientific measurement, but in reality *all grading involves a judgment call by the instructor* based on their professional expertise. And points lead to arguments about points and grades (unhelpful) rather than learning and knowledge (constructive). I believe your work should be evaluated by just like everyone else's work in the real world is evaluated, i.e., by giving you: 

- clearly defined standards for quality, 
- detailed feedback on your work instead of points, and 
- opportunities to try again based on the feedback. 
 
This gets you into a *feedback loop*, a conversation between you and me about your progress toward reaching learning objectives, a conversation that continues until your work meets the standards (or we reach the end of the semester). In light of the principles outlined above, in this course:

- *there are no points to grade your work you produce throughout the semester*---points are used in the Canvas gradebook to communicate the number of successful attempts;
- *there is no partial credit* awarded on your work; and
- students can *reattempt, revise, and resubmit almost any piece of graded work*, several times over if needed, using the feedback at each stage to improve and grow.

This is not as weird as it sounds, it's actually the way human learning naturally occurs and the way most professionals are evaluated in their work. It only seems strange because it's not how school is typically done. But school and the real world are, well, not necessarily aligned. We will take the "real world" approach. Keep reading for more details.

### Learning Targets and Checkpoints

One of your primary responsibilities in the course is to demonstrate as much skill as possible on as many Learning Targets as possible through solving LT problems during *Checkpoints*. 

Checkpoint is a period of class time set aside for assessment. We will have Checkpoints frequently (check the schedule), usually during the first 25 min if the class period. Each Learning Target is listed in the gradebook separately and is marked using the following 3-level rubric:

- **No Rating** indicates that that you did not attempt the learning target or the attempt was unsuccessful. Everyone begins the semester with "No Rating" on all Learning Targets. Shows in Canvas gradebook as `0`
- **Proficiency** indicates you successfully completed **one** LT problem, i.e., the solution met the standards for acceptable work. Shows in Canvas gradebook as `1`
- **Mastery** indicates you completed **a second** LT problem and the solution met the standards for acceptable work. Shows in Canvas gradebook as `2`. 

:::info
**Important**: Each _Learning Target_ requires two successful demonstrations of skill. Then, the LT is considered **completed** and no further assessment on that target is necessary.
:::

As the semester progresses, new Learning Targets and new versions of older ones will added to the pool of LTs available for (re)assessment. This will allow you to reattempt, on a limited basis, any Learning Target you haven't mastered. Refer to the schedule table on what LTs are available for (re)assessment. 

:::success
_Successful_ as used in descriptions above **does not mean "perfect" or "error-free"**. A limited number of minor errors is allowed. See the [companion document](https://hackmd.io/@hmuchalski/SkGJe0kii) "Standards for Reassessment in CHEM 129") for detailed description of criteria for success.
:::

#### Class Journal

To earn letter grade of B or higher you will be asked to submit Class Journal entries. Class Journal is a collection of organic chemistry problems on topics that span multiple Learning Targets. that contain a correct written solution as well as commentary and guidance for the reader. Class Journal entries are marked using EMRN rubric shown below:

![EMPX rubric](http://rtalbert.org/content/images/2022/04/EMRN-rubric-2020.png)

I will publish (and keep adding throughout the semester) a list of problems for students to sign up for. Once you sign up, you will have 1 week to submit a publication-ready solution. You may only work on one problem at a time. If more than one person requests the same problem at the same time, I will choose based on who has completed fewer journals.

Journal problems must be correct and clearly communicate the process obtaining the solution. Editor-in-Chief (me) will review your submission and choose whether to accept it or return for revisions. 


### How each assignment is graded

Refer to the table for an overview of who each assignment is graded. Details are explained below. 

| Assignment       | How it's graded                                                 | What's recorded in Canvas.               |  
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |  
| Learning Targets | Completeness and correctness                                    | `0`, `1`, or `2` (see below)             |  
| Class Primer     | Completeness and effort only                                    | `1` for Progress Bar >50%; `0` otherwise |  
| Class Journal    | Completeness, effort, correctness, and clarity of communication | `E`, `M`, `R`, or `N`                    |  
| Final ACS exam   | Correctness only (multiple choice exam)                         | Points, 70 maximum                       |  


### Final letter grade

Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to earn a particular letter grade, each requirement must be met in the column for that grade, **the highest grade for which all the requirements are met**. There are no statistical or numerical adjustments (a.k.a. grading on a curve). Failing grade (F) is given if not all the requirements for a "D" are met. In the table below, numerical values indicate the minimum level needed to meet the requirement; amounts above this level also meet the requirement. 

:::info
**Important:** You can't prop-up work on Class Journal, for example, by doing more Learning Targets. Also, you don't have to do it all. If you aim for "A", you don't have to complete _every Learning Target_. And let me repeat, to "complete" a Learning Target means to **demonstrate skill two times**. 
:::

| Category         | D  | C  | B   | A       |  
| ---------------- | -- | -- | --- | ------- |  
| Learning Targets | 5  | 7  | 10  | 13      |  
| Class Primer     |    | 7  | 10  | 13      |  
| Class Journal    |    |    | 2xM | 3xM 1xE |  
| iClicker Credits | 5  | 10 | 15  | 20      |  
| Online Homework  | 50 | 60 | 70  | 80      |  
| Final Exam       | 21 | 28 | 35  | 42      |  

:::success 
:checkered_flag: **Example** 

At the end of the semester Alex accomplished the following:

- completed 15 Class Primer assignments;
- completed (= done two successful demonstrations of skill on) 11 Learning Targets; 
- submitted 5 Class Journal (two graded "E", three graded "M"); 
- stayed engaged in class meetings and earned 20 iClicker Credits; and
- earned 54 points on the final exam.

Looking across the column for grade of "B", Alex satisfied all the requirements for that grade. Although Alex's work on Class Primers, Class Journal, and the final exam is at grade "A" level, Learning Targets are at "B" level and Alex's course letter grade will be "B". 
:::


## Reassessment policy

Except for Class Primer and the Final Exam, you can revise and resubmit any work you turn in, _without penalty_, until it meets course standards. How this works depends on the type of assessment.

**Learning Targets**. As detailed above, work on a Learning Target that doesn't meet the standards for "success" can be reattempted, through work on a new version of the same problem, on a later test.

**Class Journals**. An Class Journal earning a mark of R or N can be revised and resubmitted by uploading a revised version of the work to the same Canvas location where it was originally submitted (Canvas automatically keeps all versions of all uploads).

## Academic integrity

:::warning
:zap: This course  is subject to [Standards of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.fresnostate.edu/studentconduct/academic-integrity/) and  [The Code of Academic Integrity](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/236.pdf). Every student has the responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest activities.
:::

Some of the work you will do in the course involves collaboration; at other times collaboration may be allowed but not required; while at others it may not be allowed. Here are the specific rules for the extend of collaboration on each kind of work you do:


| Assessment | Restrictions |
| :--------  | :--------------------- |
| WileyPLUS Assignments (Primers, Homework) | no restrictions |
| Learning Targets | No collaboration is allowed but you can use your notes |
| Class Journal | No collaboration is allowed. You can use your textbook, notes, or other sources (printed or electronic) as long as source can be cited (preferably primary or secondary sources). |
| Final Exam | No collaboration is allowed |

All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be thoroughly investigated, and whether a student has committed academic dishonesty is my determination to make based on the evidence. If I suspect that academic dishonesty has been committed, a report will be filed with the Dean of Students office according to APM 235

:::info
**Important:** There's no need to be academically dishonest here, because you can revise and resubmit almost everything. Rather than give into temptation to cheat, *ask questions and use the feedback loop* so that you really grow and learn in the course.
:::

## Course policies

### Attendance and participation

Attendance is expected at all class meetings. The pace of the course is such that missing a class will result in falling behind almost immediately, and it's very hard to recover. iClicker system will be used to track attendance. 

Participation is an essential element of attendance. As mentioned before, the class is designed using flipped learning model where the majority of in-class time is spent on active participation, as opposed to passive observation of the instructor lecturing from slides. 

### Absences

If you must be absent, you do not need prior permission or justification, but a notification will be appreciated. However, *please avoid any non-essential absences* such as skipping class, or scheduling a vacation during a day where class is scheduled. If you miss, you are solely responsible for catching up. 

Missing a class meeting may also mean missing a Checkpoint. There will be no make-up Checkpoints---if you miss class you can attempt LT problems at the next Checkpoint.

### Deadlines and late work

Deadlines for Class Primers, and Class Journal are listed on Canvas. In cases of apparent conflict between dates (different date on a description page and different in the calendar), always assume that the Course Calendar is right.

| Assignment | Deadline policy |
| :--------- | :-------------- |
| Class Primers | Due at 9 am the morning before first class meeting that week |
| Class Journal | Due one week after claiming the problem. Submitted electronically on Canvas. If revisions are needed, they are due 1 week after feedback was released to the student. | 

### Instructor availability and message responses

You have a right and the responsibility to ask a question about anything you don't fully understand, at any time during the class period and during office hours. 



I do not always respond to all messages immediately because I have to prioritize a number of tasks throughout the week that make demands on my time; and I do not leave my email open all day. I typically respond to email **once per day** in the late afternoon. If you send a message on a weekday (Monday through Friday) before 3:00 pm PT, it will get a **same-day response**. Messages sent after 3:00pm on Fridays or on the weekends will get a response **no later than the following Monday afternoon**. 

### Technology issues when submitting work

It is the student’s responsibility to make sure these items are submitted on time, even if technology issues arise. Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload work to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try again later, use different browser, upload to Google Drive and share a private link or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.

### Intellectual Property

Students are prohibited from any unauthorized recording, dissemination, or publication of any academic presentation, including any online classroom instruction, for any commercial purpose. In addition, students may not record or use virtual/online instruction in any manner that would violate copyright law. Students are to use all online/virtual instruction exclusively for the educational purpose of the online class in which the instruction is being provided. Students may not re-record any online recordings or post any online recordings on any other format (e.g., electronic, video, social media, audio recording, web page, internet, hard paper copy, etc.) for any purpose without the explicit written permission of the faculty member providing the instruction. Exceptions for disability-related accommodations will be addressed by Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) working in conjunction with the student and faculty member.

## Dropping the course

Dates and details on withdrawing from courses are described on the [Admissions web pages](http://fresnostate.edu/studentaffairs/are/registration/add-drop-deadlines.html).

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition. Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious and compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.

## University policies and disclaimers

In addition to course policies, you are expected to be familiar with Academic Regulations described in the [University Catalog](http://www.fresnostate.edu/catalog/academic-regulations/) as well as policies listed below.

## Appendix A: List of Learning Targets

Learning Targets listed with a star emoji ⭐️ are CORE LTs.

1. ⭐️ I can deduce bonding information (hybridization, formal charge, geometry, valence, polarization) embedded in a chemical representations. I can draw chemical structures using bond--line (zig--zag) style.
2. I can identify functional groups and convert between different drawing conventions and styles. I can draw constitutional isomers given the atomic formula. 
3. ⭐️ I can distinguish between localized and delocalized bonding. I can draw resonance structures to show electron delocalization and assess relative their relative contribution to the electronic character of the molecule.
4. ⭐️ I can use the Brønsted–Lowry theory to explain p*K*a trends of organic acids, correlations between structure and stability of organic bases, and behavior or organic compounds in proton transfer reactions.
5. I can use drawings of structures and projection and conformational analysis to assess relative energy of conformations of chain molecules and cyclohexane derivatives.
6. I can identify types of isomeric relationships between molecules, including stereoisomeric relationships. I can use drawings of structures and projections to demonstrate stereoisomeric relationships.
7. ⭐️ I can use IUPAC nomenclature rules to convert structure to name and name to structure including markers of absolute (R/S) and relative (cis/trans, E/Z, syn/anti) stereochemical information.
8. I can categorize chemical transformations as substitution, addition, or elimination. I can identify reaction steps, draw curved arrow mechanisms, and identify flaws in mechanisms.
9. ⭐️ I can analyze thermodynamics and kinetics of chemical reactions and use reaction--energy diagrams to communicate reaction profiles. I can draw structures of transition states and reactive intermediates. 
10. ⭐️ I can solve synthesis problems involving alkyl halides and sulfonates: substitution and elimination reactions.
11. I can use conformational analysis and reaction mechanisms to explain selectivity and divergent reaction pathways of nucleophilic substitution and β-elimination reactions.
12. I can solve multi-step synthesis problems involving alkenes: elimination and addition reactions.
13. I can solve multi-step synthesis problems involving alkynes.
14. I can use conformational analysis and reaction mechanisms (ionic and radical-mediated) to explain selectivity and divergent reaction pathways of addition reactions of alkenes and alkynes.
15. I can solve multi-step synthesis problems involving alcohols, phenols, and diols.
