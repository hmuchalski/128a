<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to CHEM 128A! It’s great to have you in the course. I’m
Dr. Hubert Muchalski, the professor for this course.</p>
<p>In Organic Chemistry 1 you will learn about structure, properties,
and reactivity of organic compounds. Carbon-based molecules are central
to a host of chemical and biological processes because of their broad
range of structure and reactivity. The billions of organic compounds
alone, ranging from polymers to pharmaceuticals, make the field
important for study. Yet, organic chemistry is also a highly integrated
discipline that impacts and is impacted by the other branches of
chemistry and other sciences, because <strong>organic chemistry enables
a molecular understanding of physicochemical phenomena in materials
science, the environment, biology, and medicine</strong>. Because the
field has reached a high level of integration with these areas, progress
in organic chemistry continues at a fast pace and much more remains to
be discovered.</p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Textbook.</strong> “Organic Chemistry” online textbook with
integrated Study Guide and Solutions Manual by David Klein 4th edition
published by Wiley (via Immediate Access). It is okay to use prior
editions of the textbook but you will not have the access to the
WileyPLUS platform.</li>
<li><strong>WileyPLUS.</strong> Online learning platform with
e-textbook, practice problems, videos, etc. WileyPLUS is integrated with
Canvas and all links to assignments and materials will be posted on
Canvas.</li>
<li><strong>Student response system.</strong> Most students use iClicker
Reef mobile app but a physical remote (<em>i&gt;clicker2</em>) will also
work. Make sure you use your university email when signing up for
iClicker service or registering the physical remote.</li>
<li><strong>Canvas.</strong> The central repository for all course
materials and information found here: <a

<li><strong>Document scanning tool or a tablet with pen input.</strong>
Many assignments in this course are handwritten on paper and then
uploaded to Canvas as PDF files. A smartphone with a scanning app can be
used to convert paper documents into PDFs. There are number of free
options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that you like and
learn how to use it. Alternatively, you can use a tablet that can
capture handwriting and drawings.</li>
<li><strong>Active Fresno State network account.</strong> so that you
can access email, Canvas, and Google Suite. If you have any issue with
accessing any of the above, please let me know as soon as possible. We
will use a variety of additional course tools during the semester and
you will be taught how to use them as part of the class.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-have-a-good-experience-in-chem-128a">How to have a good
experience in CHEM 128A</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Learning is not fun. Knowledge is fun but learning is discouraging,
uncomfortable, and hard.”</p>
<p>– Unknown source</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Organic chemistry has poor reputation among college students because
it is hard and demands lots of work. Success in the course depends on
your willingness to try things that might not work the first time, and
the ability to improve using feedback. I am committed to provide
learning environment where students can construct their knowledge of
organic chemistry and grow safely and productively.</p>
<p>In this course you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>A learning environment that is challenging but also supportive of
the learning process.</li>
<li>Transparent grading practices that prioritize growth.</li>
<li>Course content that compounds over time and concepts that are
recurring throughout the semester.</li>
<li>Solicitations for your feedback that are taken seriously.</li>
<li>Respect for you as a human who is here to learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>I firmly believe that success in CHEM 128A is possible for every
student but it is not effortless. On your end, your success in the
course depends on three things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Active engagement during class time.</strong> The best way
to learn anything is to be an active participant in the process.
Students who approach the class with a passive mindset typically
struggle, and often fail. Those who approach it with an active mindset,
on the other hand, often surprise themselves with how much and how well
they learn. Make it a priority not to just attend and take notes, but
learn by doing.</li>
<li><strong>Asking questions.</strong> The material in CHEM 128A is
challenging, and you will almost certainly be confused on a regular
basis. When you recognize that you are confused or stuck, remember that
<strong>it is a expected during a meaningful learning process.</strong>
Waiting for things to make sense on their own is a poor strategy. If a
thought occurs to you that <em>“It’s only me who doesn’t get it and
others have if all figured out”</em>, don’t believe it. <em>Ask
questions</em> of me and your classmates and take action to make sense
of the material.</li>
<li><strong>Good management of time, tasks, and information.</strong>
Understanding the material won’t help you if you procrastinate, skip
announcements, or don’t use a calendar. All course information will be
clearly laid out for you, but it’s up to you to import that information
into your own lives and act on it. If you can commit to these, then I
have every expectation that you’ll succeed in the course, no matter what
your prior chemistry background.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-study-organic-chemistry">Why study organic chemistry?</h2>
<p>“To be an organic chemist, or course!” one might say. The fact is,
that less than 1% of all students I taught this course in the past are
practicing chemists or pursue a graduate degree in the physical
sciences. For most students this course is just a part of the curriculum
or a requirement for an advanced training program in health-related
field. Then why is this course a hard requirement for many career paths?
Successful completion of organic chemistry is <a
href="https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Economics/Principles_of_Microeconomics_(Curtis_and_Irvine)/05%3A_The_Factors_of_Production/13%3A_Human_capital_and_the_income_distribution/13.04%3A_Education_as_signalling">a
signal to the outside world</a>. It demonstrates your competence in
self-regulated learning, proving that you can quickly learn hard
abstract concepts and that you know how to work with models and
theories. Doing well in organic chemistry also reveals that you can
manage time and tasks, and that you can use highly technical language to
communicate with peers.</p>
<h1 id="course-goals-and-structure">Course goals and structure</h1>
<p>The goal of this course is to illustrate that by understanding the
principles of bonding and reactivity chemists can design molecules that
serve specific function, especially in the contexts relevant to other
disciplines: medicine, biology, and material science. To get closer to
achieving course goal, we will focus on a variety of skills.</p>
<h2 id="course-learning-objectives">Course learning objectives</h2>
<p>At the successful completion of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use common drawing and naming conventions to represent the structure
and properties of organic molecules.</li>
<li>Rationalize physical phenomena using polarity and intermolecular
forces.</li>
<li>Use curved arrow notation to draw mechanisms of chemical
transformations.</li>
<li>Analyze chemical structures and reactions to make predictions about
chemical processes.</li>
<li>Explain the reasoning behind solutions to problems clearly to an
appropriate audience.</li>
<li>Predict products of chemical reactions.</li>
<li>Propose a synthesis of an organic molecule.</li>
<li>Self-assess your work and apply feedback from others to make
improvements in that work.</li>
<li>Connect the ideas of organic chemistry with your own personal and
professional interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The skills and conceptual knowledge that you’ll learn in the course
are encapsulated in a list of 15 Learning Targets, eight (8) of which
are labelled as CORE targets and represent the essential skills that
every CHEM 128A student should possess by the end of the course. You can
find that list in Appendix A, and it’s linked elsewhere on our various
course sites.</p>
<h2 id="course-content-and-workflow">Course content and workflow</h2>
<p>To achieve course-level objectives we need material to work with.
Topics in this course will be roughly follow the order of chapters in
the textbook (Chapters 1–12). Each class meeting has activities for you
to do before, during and after the class. For details on specific
assignment types, see the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Before class.</strong> To prepare for class your task will be
to complete <strong>Class Primer</strong> assignments and get familiar
with the basic concepts related to the topic of the upcoming class and
review previously covered material. I will provide a list of suggested
reading and video content for you to review before the lesson. You’ll
then complete a small set of basic questions and exercises. This way,
you’ll come to class ready to work, and we can skip lectures on the
basics in class unless it’s really needed.</p>
<p><strong>During class.</strong> Wee will be focused on <em>answering
questions</em> and <em>doing active work</em>, both intended to make it
easy for you to make sense of the material and ask questions so you can
maximize the impact of your studying between classes.</p>
<p><strong>After class.</strong> You will continue to engage with the
material through practice and deliberation on the ideas discussed in
class. You will return to relevant sections of the textbook to review
diagrams and illustrations. The goal of these activities is to prepare
you to attempt <strong>Learning Target</strong> problems on Checkpoints
and work on <strong>Class Journal</strong> articles.</p>
<p>A typical week could be structured as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Sunday</strong> - Complete Class Primer for Monday</li>
<li><strong>Monday</strong> - Q&amp;A from Class Primer and active work
on more advanced concepts from Class Primer</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday</strong> - Complete Class Primer for Wednesday</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday</strong> - Q&amp;A from Class Primer and active
work on more advanced concepts from Class Primer</li>
<li><strong>Thursday</strong> - Review of the concepts, solving
additional problems, work on Class Journal</li>
<li><strong>Friday</strong> - Review of the concepts, solving additional
problems, work on Class Journal</li>
<li><strong>Saturday</strong> - If you stay current on work during the
week you should have Saturday open to do the busy work other professors
assign in their courses.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="assessments-and-grading">Assessments and grading</h1>
<p>The course uses a <em>growth grading system</em> in which your work
will be required to meet certain levels of quality that demonstrate
mastery of the material.</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost none of your assignments have point values. In fact only the
final exam is graded with points. Therefore there is no partial credit
and no averaging. Numbers are only used in the Canvas gradebook to
communicate the number of successful attempts on assignments.</li>
<li>Instead, assignments have standards which are descriptions of what
constitutes acceptable work. These are given in detail in the document
<a
href="https://github.com/hmuchalski/ochem1/blob/main/CHEM128A-AY23-24-Fall/standards-for-student-work.md">Standards
for Student Work</a> which you can find at the link and on Canvas. When
you turn in work for grading, I will read it carefully and compare it
with the standards, and simply determine whether it meets the standards
or not. Typically your work is marked either <em>Success</em> or
<em>Retry</em> depending on whether it meets the criteria or not.</li>
<li>After I evaluate your work, in most cases you will receive detailed
feedback that will tell you whether your work meets the standards, and
if not, the feedback will tell you what was missing and how you might go
about fixing it.</li>
<li>In most cases you will have the chance to retry the assignment if
needed, get more feedback, and repeat this feedback loop until the work
meets our standards.</li>
<li>Your course grade is not based on point totals or averages (because
there are no point values). Instead, the course grade is based on how
many important learning tasks you’ve successfully accomplished by the
end of the semester, according to the table below.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gets you into a <em>feedback loop</em>, a conversation between
you and me about your progress toward reaching learning objectives, a
conversation that continues until your work meets the standards (or we
reach the end of the semester).</p>
<p>As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that <em>learning takes
time</em> and that grading your work based on a single point of data,
such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps
unethical. A truly valid measure of learning has to involve <em>multiple
attempts</em> that allow you to learn from (and correct) your past
mistakes and demonstrate not only your skill, but also your growth. I
believe you should not be penalized for having a bad day that results in
a bad test score, so long as you can show evidence that you’ve
<em>eventually</em> learned what you need to learn. Course learning
objectives are phrased as “at the end of the course the student should
be able to…”. Thus, nothing is final until the end of the course.</p>
<p>This is actually the way human learning happens outside of college.
In your future jobs, for example, you’ll be reviewed regularly by your
manager; it’s not a “one and done” situation where you get a point score
and then the process is over. Instead, in a real job, you get feedback
and coaching on how to improve, and then you act on the feedback and
show the manager that you have improved.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-assessments">Types of assessments</h2>
<p>You will be engaging with several kinds of activities in the course,
both to facilitate learning of the material and to demonstrate how well
you have learned it. These include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Class Primers.</strong> Pre-class assignments designed to
give you the basic knowledge of terms, ideas, and basic concepts that
will allow us to jump right into applications when we get to class. They
involve reading the textbook, asking questions about what you read, and
completing Skill Builder exercises.</li>
<li><strong>iClicker Credits.</strong> In-class student response polls
(iClicker Reef) that guide the discussion and give me feedback when
class-wide confusion arises. You will receive one credit if you
participate in (= give answer to) 75% of questions asked in class
session. You should try your best to answer correctly but correctness is
not factored into the score, only participation.</li>
<li><strong>Checkpoints.</strong> Almost every week I will set aside
some class time for a timed quiz over a subset of the 15 Learning
Targets <a href="#appendix-a-list-of-learning-targets">found in Appendix
A</a>. Your primary goal is to provide evidence of learning by solving
LT problems.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Class Journal.</strong> Short papers that <em>show and
communicate</em> complete solution to an integrated problem that assess
student skills across multiple learning objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Final exam</strong> will be on <strong>Wednesday, December
13th, 2023 at 15:30</strong>. The final exam is composed of 70 multiple
choice questions designed by education experts from the American
Chemical Society. Exam time is 110 minutes.</li>

<h2 id="learning-targets-and-checkpoints">Learning Targets and
Checkpoints</h2>
<p>The <a href="#appendix-a-list-of-learning-targets">15 Learning
Targets given in Appendix A</a> are not the only things that matter in
the course but a part of your job in the course is to demonstrate skill
on as many of these Learning Targets as you can, at some point in the
semester.</p>
<p>Checkpoint is a period of class time set aside for a short in-class
quiz. Each Checkpoint contains a set of problems, one problem for each
<em>Learning Target</em>. Correct solution to a <em>Learning Target</em>
problem is a demonstration of skill on that target. One of your primary
responsibilities in the course is to demonstrate as much skill as
possible on as many Learning Targets as possible. Each <em>Learning
Target</em> will be a separate column in Canvas Gradebook.</p>
<p>Everyone begins the semester with <code>0</code> on all Learning
Targets in Canvas gradebook. Once you have provided <strong>two
successful demonstrations of skill</strong> on a Learning Target, you
are considered to have mastered that concept, and no further quiz work
is necessary. The Canvas gradebook will show <code>1</code> and
<code>2</code> to communicate the number of successful attempts.</p>
<h2 id="class-journal">Class Journal</h2>
<p>Integrated problems called Class Journal articles will be used to
assess broader range of skills and knowledge that span multiple Learning
Targets. Class Journal <em>article</em> must contain a solution to the
problem but also commentary and guidance for the reader. The article
should be standalone artifact of organic chemistry knowledge from which
a reader can learn. Class Journal submissions will require a formal
writeup, and may require additional technology. Consult the <a
href="https://github.com/hmuchalski/ochem1/blob/main/CHEM128A-AY23-24-Fall/standards-for-student-work.md">Standards
for Student Work</a> document for specific criteria that will be used to
evaluate Class Journal submissions.</p>
<p>I will publish (and keep adding throughout the semester) a list of
problems for students to sign up for. Once you sign up, you will have 1
week to submit your entry for review. You may only work on one new
problem at a time (it is okay to work on a new problem and a revision of
previous problem at the same time). If more than one person requests the
same problem at the same time, I will choose based on who has completed
fewer journals. Journal problems must be correct and clearly communicate
the process obtaining the solution. Editor-in-Chief (me) will review
your submission and choose whether to accept it or return for
revisions.</p>
<h2 id="final-letter-grades">Final letter grades</h2>
<p>Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to
earn a particular letter grade, each requirement must be met in the
column for that grade, <strong>the highest grade for which all the
requirements are met</strong>. There are no statistical or numerical
adjustments (a.k.a. grading on a curve). Failing grade (F) is given if
not all the requirements for a “D” are met. In the table below,
numerical values indicate the minimum level needed to meet the
requirement; amounts above this level also meet the requirement.</p>
<p>If the total number of assignments of a given type is changed due to
scheduling or other issues, this table will be updated. “M+” means mark
“M” or better. I recommend using Course Grade Tracker as the semester
progresses to have a full view of your course grade.</p>

<!-- :::info
**Important:** You can't prop-up work on Class Journal, for example, by doing more Learning Targets. Also, you don't have to do it all. If you aim for "A", you don't have to complete _every Learning Target_. And let me repeat, to "complete" a Learning Target means to **demonstrate skill two times**. 
::: -->
<h2 id="revisions-and-reattempts">Revisions and reattempts</h2>
<p>You can reattempt <em>Learning Targets</em> and revise <em>Class

href="https://github.com/hmuchalski/ochem1/blob/main/CHEM128A-AY23-24-Fall/standards-for-student-work.md">Standards
for Student Work</a> document. This allows you to keep working on a
concept and eventually demonstrate your understanding for full credit,
even if your initial attempts aren’t successful. However, there are some
limits to how and when revision and/or reattempt is possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be at least 3 opportunities to solve each <em>Learning
Target</em> problem plus one last opportunity during the week of
December 4.</li>
<li>Class Journal can only be revised two times and only one article can
be submitted for review per week. No submissions are allowed after 11:59
pm on Sunday, December 3.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="getting-help">Getting help</h1>
<p>As mentioned, you will almost certainly find yourself lost, stuck, or
confused on <em>something</em> in this course at some point. This is not
a defect in your character or intelligence; it’s a sign you are being
challenged, and you can turn that challenge into real growth by
<strong>seeking out help as soon as you need it</strong>. Make every
effort to get yourself unstuck and resolve your questions on your own
first. But then:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attend office hours and ask questions there.</strong> No
appointment needed.</li>
<li><a href="https://calendar.app.google/mHM77jzbU5KJoiaF6">Schedule an
appointment through Google Calendar</a> if drop-in hours don’t work for
you.</li>
<li><strong>Work with a classmate</strong> as long as you’re staying
within bounds on academic honesty above. In particular, working in
groups on Class Prep is a very good idea and will help keep you from
getting stuck at the beginning of a new concept.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructor-availability-and-message-responses">Instructor
availability and message responses</h2>
<p><strong>You can ask a question about anything at any time.</strong>
You have both the right and the responsibility to ask questions about
anything in the course you don’t fully understand, whether math or some
aspect of the syllabus or anything else. You can use email
(hmuchalski@mail.fresnostate.edu), office hours, appointments, or grab
me before or after class.</p>
<p>However, please note that I cannot always respond immediately to
messages. In particular <strong>I do not typically check email between
6:00pm and 6:00am on weeknights</strong>, and <strong>I do not typically
check email at all on weekends</strong> in order to prioritize time for
family and other non-work pursuits. That said,</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages sent on a weekday (Monday-Friday) before 3:00 pm will
likely get a response <em>the same day</em>.</li>
<li>Messages sent after 3:00 pm Monday-Thursday will get a response
<em>the next day</em>.</li>
<li>Messages sent after 3:00 pm on Fridays or on the weekend will get a
response <em>the following Monday</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please plan ahead for instructor availability.</strong> For
example if you have something to turn in on a Friday, and you send a
question by email after 3:00pm, my reply may not come in time to help
you; plan ahead for contingencies like this.</p>

than engage in academic dishonesty and putting your entire career at
risk, just turn in your best complete good-faith effort on assignments.
And then, if revisions are needed, you’ll typically get the chance. The
important thing in CHEM 128A is not the grade, it’s the understanding
and growth you get from engaging in a feedback loop on your work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You <strong>are allowed and encouraged to collaborate with
others</strong> on <em>Class Primer</em> assignments as long as your
responses reflect your own understanding and are not merely copied from
another. Remember, these are only graded on completeness and effort, and
mistakes are not penalized, so don’t copy! It will only make you lost in
class.</p>
<p>You <strong>are not allowed to collaborate with others</strong> on
<em>Checkpoints</em>, <em>Class Journal</em>, and <em>Final Exam</em>.
To draft your article for <em>Class Journal</em> you can use your
textbook, notes, or other sources (printed or electronic) as long as
source can be cited (preferably primary or secondary sources).</p>
<p>Definition of “others”: Current students in your section of CHEM
128A; students in other sections of CHEM 128A; former students from CHEM
128A; graduate students; discussion-oriented websites like StackExchange
or Reddit; and artificial intelligence applications such as Bard, Bing,
and ChatGPT. The intention here is that <strong>the work you submit is
your thinking, not someone or something else’s.</strong></p>
<p>I have no interest in creating a police state in your course. But I
am obliged to investigate any evidence I perceive in which a student is
submitting work that does not faithfully represent their own
understanding. This investigation may involve discussions about the work
or a request to reproduce the work or something like it, in a
face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p>You can ask me (Dr. M.) any question you want, about anything, at any
time. Getting help from the professor is not academic dishonesty! In
case I cannot answer a question because it would reveal spoilers for the
solution, I’ll tell you so and it will be no big deal. Asking a question
will never be held against you.</p>
<h2 id="attendance-and-participation">Attendance and participation</h2>
<p>Attendance is expected at all class meetings. The pace of the course
is such that missing a class will result in falling behind almost
immediately, and it’s very hard to recover. iClicker credits are the
incentive to attend classes regularly. Participation is an essential
element of attendance. As mentioned before, the class is designed using
flipped learning model where the majority of in-class time is spent on
active participation, as opposed to passive observation of the
instructor lecturing from slides.</p>
<h2 id="absences">Absences</h2>
<p>If you must be absent, you do not need prior permission or
justification, but a notification will be appreciated. However,
<em>please avoid any non-essential absences</em> such as skipping class,
or scheduling a vacation during a day where class is scheduled. If you
miss, you are solely responsible for catching up. Missing a class
meeting may also mean missing a Checkpoint. There will be no make-up
Checkpoints—if you miss class you can attempt LT problems at the next
Checkpoint.</p>
<h2 id="deadlines-and-late-work">Deadlines and late work</h2>
<p>Deadlines for Class Primers, and Class Journal are listed on Canvas.
In cases of apparent conflict between dates (different date on a
description page and different in the calendar), always assume that the
Course Calendar is right.</p>

<h2 id="technology-issues-when-submitting-work">Technology issues when
submitting work</h2>
<p>It is the student’s responsibility to make sure these items are
submitted on time, even if technology issues arise. Technology issues
that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be
considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you
are trying to upload work to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file,
you should try again later, use different browser, upload to Google
Drive and share a private link or send the file as an email attachment
until you can upload it successfully.</p>
<h2 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>Students are prohibited from any unauthorized recording,
dissemination, or publication of any academic presentation, including
any online classroom instruction, for any commercial purpose. In
addition, students may not record or use virtual/online instruction in
any manner that would violate copyright law. Students are to use all
online/virtual instruction exclusively for the educational purpose of
the online class in which the instruction is being provided. Students
may not re-record any online recordings or post any online recordings on
any other format (e.g., electronic, video, social media, audio
recording, web page, internet, hard paper copy, etc.) for any purpose
without the explicit written permission of the faculty member providing
the instruction. Exceptions for disability-related accommodations will
be addressed by Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) working in
conjunction with the student and faculty member.</p>
<h2 id="dropping-the-course">Dropping the course</h2>
<p>Dates and details on withdrawing from courses are described on the <a

<p>A <em>serious and compelling reason</em> is defined as an unexpected
condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that
unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student’s ability to attend
class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be
acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the
department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the
appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that
substantiates the condition. Failing or performing poorly in a class is
not an acceptable “serious and compelling reason” within the University
policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or
instructor.</p>
<h2 id="university-policies-and-disclaimers">University policies and

<h1 id="appendix-a-list-of-learning-targets">Appendix A: List of
Learning Targets</h1>
<p>Here are the suggested edits and grammar corrections for your list of
learning objectives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>(<strong>CORE</strong>) I can deduce bonding information
(hybridization, formal charge, geometry, valence, charge polarization)
embedded in chemical representations. I can draw Lewis structures
compliant with the bond-line (zig-zag) convention.</li>
<li>I can identify functional groups and common abbreviations. I can
convert between different drawing conventions and styles and recognize
implicit carbons and hydrogens in a structure.</li>
<li>(<strong>CORE</strong>) I can distinguish between localized and
delocalized bonding systems. I can draw resonance structures to show
electron delocalization and assess their relative contribution to the
overall electronic character of the molecule.</li>
<li>(<strong>CORE</strong>) I can rationalize acidity and basicity
trends of organic molecules according to the Brønsted–Lowry theory.</li>
<li>(<strong>CORE</strong>) I can predict the position of acid-base
equilibrium and choose a suitable reagent for an efficient proton
transfer reaction.</li>
<li>I can use various projections of structures and conformational
analysis to assess the relative energy of conformations of chain
molecules and cyclohexane derivatives.</li>
<li>I can identify types of isomeric relationships between molecules. I
can use drawings of structures and projections to demonstrate the
stereoisomeric relationship between molecules.</li>
<li>(<strong>CORE</strong>) I can use IUPAC nomenclature rules to
convert structure to name and name to structure, including markers of
absolute (R/S) and relative (<em>cis</em>/<em>trans</em>,
<em>E</em>/<em>Z</em>, <em>syn</em>/<em>anti</em>) stereochemical
information.</li>
<li>(<strong>CORE</strong>) I can identify reaction mechanism patterns
and draw curved arrows to illustrate bond-forming and bond-breaking
steps. I can draw structures of transition states and reactive
intermediates. I can identify nucleophilic and electrophilic centers in
organic molecules.</li>
<li>I can categorize chemical transformations as substitution, addition,
or elimination. I can determine the change in enthalpy using values of
bond dissociation energy. I can use reaction-energy diagrams to
communicate the kinetics and thermodynamics of chemical reactions.</li>
<li>(<strong>CORE</strong>) Given an incomplete chemical reaction
scheme, I can provide missing reactants, products, or reagents &amp;
conditions for transformations involving alkyl halides and
sulfonates.</li>
<li>I can explain the selectivity and divergent reaction pathways of
nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions using conformational
analysis and curved arrow mechanisms.</li>
<li>Given an incomplete chemical reaction scheme, I can provide missing
reactants, products, or reagents &amp; conditions for transformations
involving alkenes.</li>
<li>I can identify the monomer and type of polymerization (cationic,
anionic, or radical) needed to prepare a given polymer. I can draw a
mechanism of formation of a tetramer for the selected polymer.</li>
<li>Given an incomplete chemical reaction scheme, I can provide missing
reactants, products, or reagents &amp; conditions for transformations
involving alkynes</li>
