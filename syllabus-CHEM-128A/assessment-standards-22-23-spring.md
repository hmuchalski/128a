# Standards for Assessment in CHEM 128

In the syllabus I regularly refer to *successful* or *acceptable* work without defining it. This document is an attempt at defining those categories. Use the table of contents in the upper-left to navigate to specific assignment types. 

## Class Primer

Class Primers are WileyPLUS assignments done prior to the class. You get credit for completing the assignment before the deadline and giving each item a good faith effort to solve it correctly. As you answer questions you will see the `Progress Bar` move, it can increase and decrease based on how you’re doing. Once you pass the threshold of 50% AND attempt all questions you earn credit for this assignment (shows as `1`). 

## Online Homework

Homework assignments are weekly assignments that give you space to practice what we covered that week. Similarly to Class Primers, you work on "charging" the `Progress Bar` by solving problems. Passing the threshold of 50% gives you 5 points, passing 80% gives you 8 point, reaching 100% earns 10 points.

All WileyPLUS assignments use adaptive learning engine. This means that then number and difficulty of questions is determined by how you are doing. Before each batch of questions you will be asked to review relevant sections in the textbook. Incorrect answers are not penelized, i.e., the difficulty is adjusted until you answer correctly, although some additional review may be needed.

## Learning Targets

The primary way of demonstrating skill on a Learning Target is to solve LT problem during Checkpoint, a period of class time set aside for assessment. We will have Checkpoints frequently (check the schedule), usually during the first 25 min if the class period. Your work on LT problems are graded on the basis of *completeness and correctness*. 

| The work receives a mark of... | If it meets these criteria: | 
| :----: | ---- | 
| **Successful** | <ul><li>Each part of the problem has a good-faith attempt at a response, *and*</li><li>The response contains **no more than two simple errors**, and **no non-simple errors**, *and*</li><li>Unless specifically stated otherwise, the response must show all the significant steps used to arrive at the answers.</li></ul>
| **Retry** | Not all the standards for "Successful" are met. |

**Note:** The above are *general* criteria for successful demonstrations of skill on a quiz problem. Some quiz problems may have different or more targeted criteria that will be clearly stated on the quiz.

### Alternative ways to demonstrate skill

:::success
You can demonstrate your skill and knowledge during office hours as an oral presentation. In this option, you schedule an appointment, I’ll give you a new instance of a problem, a whiteboard marker, and your job will be to generate the solution on the spot. No more than one LT problem per week can be attempted via oral examination.

### What is a "simple error"?

For CHEM 128, a **simple error** is an error in logic, computation, or communication that does not pertain to the learning target and does not oversimplify the problem.

An example of a *simple error* would be missing a formal charge on a functional group that is not the active participant in a reaction or "copy/paste error" of the structure from one part of the solution to another that has different number of carbons. However, if the reaction in context is a carbon–carbon bond forming reaction and the number of carbons is inconsistent, then it is a non-simple error. 

Note that an error that is considered "simple" in one situation may be "non-simple" in another and only two simple errors are allowed on any Learning Target problem. So always double-check your work when possible, and proofread your solutions before submitting them. 

## Class Journal

Journal solutions are graded on the basis of *completeness, correctness, and communication quality*. Solutions are marked using the **EMRN rubric** shown below.

### Specific requirements for "Meets Expectations"

:::success
Note: **The audience for all Journal solutions is your classmates** --- people who have the background chemistry knowledge that you have, but who have no familiarity with the problem you are working on. **The instructor (prof. Muchalski) is not the audience, and neither are you**---so don't assume that the person reading the solution has a graduate degree in organic chemistry or has been studying the topic for a while. 
::: 

For an Journal solution to "Meet Expectations" it must: 

- Obey fundamental rules of English usage such as correct spelling, proper use of punctuation, use of complete sentences and proper paragraph structure, and so on. 
- Be chemically correct and include no significant errors. Note that *minor* errors can sometimes be acceptable as long as they don't derail the solution. You should always proofread your work to debug those errors, because sometimes an error that is minor in one context is significant in another. 
- Give not just an answer but a full, convincing, and well-reasoned commentary that will make the work stand on its own.
- The solution should thoughtfully combine chemistry and verbal explanations to be clear and convincing to the intended audience. When giving a solution, don't just present a "wall of structures/reactions/symbols" without verbal description. Likewise, don't write a block of text describing the solution without using the visual language of organic chemistry. Instead, use a combination of words, structures, reactions, and mechanisms that explains your ideas clearly to a standard audience. 

### Specific requirements for "Excellent/Exemplary"

An exemplary solution must first meet all objectives listed for "Meets Expectations". In addition, your work must also be very well communicated. In simple terms, "Excellent/Exemplary" work could be used as class handout. A student in our class who is familiar with organic chemistry terminology and conventions, could learn the topic just from reading your Journal submission. Here are some guidelines:

* **Demonstrate fluency and comfort with the ideas in your solution**. Show that you fully understand what matters (and what doesn’t) in your solution, and how to properly use all terminology and ideas.
* **Write concisely and elegantly**. Find the most direct, clear, and unambiguous way to say what you mean. Avoid irrelevant flourishes or details. If you find a complex solution that requires many multiple pages of structures and long blocks of text, perhaps there is a simpler way to do it -- find that simpler approach.

### Criteria for "Not Assessable"

An Journal submission is marked `N` (Not Assessable) if it does not represent a good-faith effort to meet the standards. This mark will be given in *any* of these circumstances: 

- Part of the solution is blank, partially complete, or contains insignificant attempts at a solution. For example, completing part of a problem and then explaining that you didn't know how to complete the other parts will result in an`N`.  
- There are significant and numerous major errors or misconceptions on chemistry or logic that occur throughout the work.
- The submission is significantly disorganized, illegible, messy, or unprofessionally written up. Text that is handwritten must be legible. Journal solutions that are marked `N` will be marked and returned without feedback (except for an explanation why it was marked `N`).
