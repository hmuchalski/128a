<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to CHEM 128A! It’s great to have you in the course. I’m
Dr. Hubert Muchalski, the professor for this course.</p>
<p>In Organic Chemistry 1 you will learn about structure, properties,
and reactivity of organic compounds. Carbon-based molecules are central
to a host of chemical and biological processes because of their broad
range of structure and reactivity. The billions of organic compounds
alone, from amino acids, benzene, and cyclohexane derivatives, to
xanthanes, ylides, and zwitterions, make the field important for study.
At the same time, organic chemistry is also a highly integrated
discipline that impacts and is impacted by the other branches of
chemistry and other sciences, because <strong>organic chemistry enables
understanding of cellular machinery of living organisms, physical
properties of materials, effects of chemicals on the environment, and
how medicines work</strong>. Because the field has reached a high level
of integration with these areas, progress in organic chemistry continues
at a fast pace and much more remains to be discovered.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-have-a-good-experience-in-chem-128a">How to have a good
experience in CHEM 128A</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Learning is not fun. Knowledge is fun but learning is discouraging,
uncomfortable, and hard.”</p>
<p>– Unknown source</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Organic chemistry has poor reputation among college students because
it is hard and demands lots of work. Success in the course depends on
your willingness to try things that might not work the first time, and
the ability to improve using feedback. I am committed to provide
learning environment where students can construct their knowledge of
organic chemistry and grow safely and productively.</p>
<p>In this course you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>A learning environment that is challenging but also supportive of
the learning process.</li>
<li>Transparent grading practices that prioritize growth.</li>
<li>Course content that compounds over time and concepts that are
recurring throughout the semester.</li>
<li>Solicitations for your feedback that are taken seriously.</li>
<li>Respect for you as a human who is here to learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>I firmly believe that success in CHEM 128A is possible for every
student but it is not effortless. On your end, your success in the
course depends on three things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Active engagement during class time.</strong> The best way
to learn anything is to be an active participant in the process.
Students who approach the class with a passive mindset typically
struggle, and often fail. Those who approach it with an active mindset,
on the other hand, often surprise themselves with how much and how well
they learn. Make it a priority not to just attend and take notes, but
learn by doing.</li>
<li><strong>Asking questions.</strong> The material in CHEM 128A is
challenging, and you will almost certainly be confused on a regular
basis. When you recognize that you are confused or stuck, remember that
<strong>it is a expected during a meaningful learning process.</strong>
Waiting for things to make sense on their own is a poor strategy. If a
thought occurs to you that <em>“It’s only me who doesn’t get it and
others have if all figured out”</em>, don’t believe it. <em>Ask
questions</em> of me and your classmates and take action to make sense
of the material.</li>
<li><strong>Good management of time, tasks, and information.</strong>
Understanding the material won’t help you if you procrastinate, skip
announcements, or don’t use a calendar. All course information will be
clearly laid out for you, but it’s up to you to import that information
into your own lives and act on it. If you can commit to these, then I
have every expectation that you’ll succeed in the course, no matter what
your prior chemistry background.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-study-organic-chemistry">Why study organic chemistry?</h3>
<p>“To be an organic chemist, or course!” one might say. The fact is,
that less than 1% of all students I taught this course in the past are
practicing chemists or pursue a graduate degree in the physical
sciences. For most students this course is just a part of the curriculum
or a requirement for an advanced training program in health-related
field. Then why is this course a hard requirement for many career paths?
Successful completion of organic chemistry is <a
href="https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Economics/Principles_of_Microeconomics_(Curtis_and_Irvine)/05%3A_The_Factors_of_Production/13%3A_Human_capital_and_the_income_distribution/13.04%3A_Education_as_signalling">a
signal to the outside world</a>. It demonstrates your competence in
self-regulated learning, proving that you can quickly learn hard
abstract concepts and that you know how to work with models and
theories. Doing well in organic chemistry also reveals that you can
manage time and tasks, and that you can use highly technical language to
communicate with peers.</p>
<h2 id="course-goals-and-structure">Course goals and structure</h2>
<p>The goal of this course is to illustrate that by understanding the
principles of bonding and reactivity chemists can design molecules that
serve specific function, especially in the contexts relevant to other
disciplines: medicine, biology, and material science. To get closer to
achieving course goal, we will focus on a variety of skills.</p>
<h3 id="course-learning-objectives">Course learning objectives</h3>
<p>At the successful completion of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use common drawing and naming conventions to represent the structure
and properties of organic molecules.</li>
<li>Explain macroscopic physical properties of compounds using
molecule-level phenomena (polarity and intermolecular forces).</li>
<li>Use curved arrow notation to draw mechanisms of chemical
transformations.</li>
<li>Analyze chemical structures and reactions to make predictions about
chemical processes.</li>
<li>Predict products of chemical reactions.</li>
<li>Propose a synthesis of an organic molecule.</li>
<li>Explain the reasoning behind solutions to problems clearly to an
appropriate audience.</li>
<li>Connect the ideas of organic chemistry with your own personal and
professional interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The skills and conceptual knowledge that you’ll learn in the course
are encapsulated in a list of 14 Learning Targets, six (6) of which are
labelled as CORE targets and represent the essential skills that every
CHEM 128A student should possess by the end of the course. You can find
that list in <a href="#appendix-a-list-of-learning-targets">Appendix
A</a>, and it’s linked elsewhere on our various course sites.</p>
<h3 id="course-content-and-workflow">Course content and workflow</h3>
<p>To achieve course-level objectives we need material to work with.
Topics in this course will be roughly follow the order of chapters in
the textbook. Each class meeting has activities for you to do before,
during and after the class. For details on specific assignment types,
see the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Before class.</strong> To prepare for class your task will be
to complete <strong>Class Primer</strong> assignments and get familiar
with the basic concepts related to the topic of the upcoming class and
review previously covered material. I will provide a list of suggested
reading and video content for you to review before the lesson. You’ll
then complete a small set of basic questions and exercises. This way,
you’ll come to class ready to work, and we can skip lectures on the
basics in class unless it’s really needed.</p>
<p><strong>During class.</strong> Wee will be focused on <em>answering
questions</em> and <em>doing active work</em>, both intended to make it
easy for you to make sense of the material and ask questions so you can
maximize the impact of your studying between classes.</p>
<p><strong>After class.</strong> You will continue to engage with the
material through practice and deliberation on the ideas discussed in
class. You will return to relevant sections of the textbook to review
diagrams and illustrations. The goal of these activities is to prepare
you to attempt <strong>Learning Target</strong> problems on Checkpoints
and work on <strong>Integrated Problems</strong>.</p>
<p>A typical week could be structured as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Monday</strong> - Class meeting: Q&amp;A from Class Primer
and active work on more advanced concepts</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday</strong> - Complete Class Primer for Wednesday</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday</strong> - Class meeting: Q&amp;A from Class
Primer and active work on more advanced concepts</li>
<li><strong>Thursday</strong> - Review of the concepts, solving
additional problems, work on Integrated Problems</li>
<li><strong>Friday</strong> - Review of the concepts, solving additional
problems, work on Integrated Problems</li>
<li><strong>Saturday</strong> - Complete Class Primer for Monday</li>
<li><strong>Sunday</strong> - If you stay current on work during the
week you should have Sundays free to do the busy work other professors
assign in their courses.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assessments-and-grading">Assessments and grading</h2>
<h3 id="types-of-assessments">Types of assessments</h3>
<p>The course uses a grading system that emphasizes <em>growth</em> and
your work will be required to meet certain levels of quality that
demonstrate mastery of the material. You will be engaging with several
kinds of activities in the course, both to facilitate learning of the
material and to demonstrate how well you have learned it. There are
three areas that contribute to your course grade:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mastery of basic skills (the craft);</li>
<li>Application of those basic skills (integration); and</li>
<li>Engagement, effort, and participation (community).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mastery-of-basic-skills">Mastery of basic skills</h4>
<p><a href="#course-learning-objectives">Course-level learning
objectives</a> are too broad to be assessed and are further broken down
into 14 <em>Learning Targets</em>, (see the complete list in <a
href="#appendix-a-list-of-learning-targets">Appendix A</a>). Each
learning target is focused on a specific skill and/or content we will be
studying. Six (6) of these are designated as <strong>CORE</strong>
skills and mastering those is one of the requirements for passing the
course.</p>
<p>You demonstrate your learning by solving <strong>LT Problems</strong>
during Checkpoints, in-class times set aside for assessment. Think of
Checkpoints as exams. For each <em>Learning Target</em> I set three
levels of achievement: <em>Beginner</em>, <em>Proficient</em>, and
<em>Master</em>. Detailed rubrics on how those marks are given can be
found in the <a
href="https://github.com/hmuchalski/ochem1/blob/main/CHEM128A-AY-24-25-Fall/standards-for-student-work.md">Standards
for Student Work</a> document.</p>
<h4 id="application-of-skills">Application of skills</h4>
<p>Using cooking as analogy, a chef uses their knowledge of ingredients
and basic skills to prepare a dish or a meal. Similarly, <em>Integrated
Problems</em> will assess broader range of skills and knowledge that
span multiple Learning Targets. Solving integrated problems will require
use of multiple basic OChem skills <em>and</em> communication skills to
compose and convey the answer. <em>Integrated Problems</em> will be
released roughly every other week. The problems may have multiple parts
composed of basic and extended practice problems, and harder problems
that involve applications. Think of this assignment as a short paper
that is evaluated as a whole using a rubric found in the <a
href="https://github.com/hmuchalski/ochem1/blob/main/CHEM128A-AY-24-25-Fall/standards-for-student-work.md">Standards
for Student Work</a> document.</p>
<h4 id="engagement">Engagement</h4>
<p>Ongoing engagement with the course is an important part of the
learning process. <strong>Class Primers</strong> and <strong>iClicker
polls</strong> are two ways you can earn <strong>Engagement
Credits</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Class Primers</strong> are pre-class assignments designed to
give you the basic knowledge of terms, ideas, and basic concepts that
will allow us to jump right into applications when we get to class. They
involve reading the textbook, asking questions about what you read, and
completing <em>Skill Exercises</em>. Think of this as
<em>Homework</em>.</p>
<p><strong>iClicker Credits</strong> are earned by participation in
polls during class. Polls give me real-time feedback and help steer
class discussions. They are also my way of encouraging you to attend
class meetings. You will receive one credit if you participate in, i.e.,
give answer to, 75% of questions asked in class session. You should try
your best to answer correctly but correctness is not factored into the
score, only participation. The number of questions in polls will vary;
sometimes only two or three questions.</p>
<h3 id="how-course-final-grades-are-determined">How course final grades
are determined</h3>
<p>Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to
earn a particular letter grade, all requirements in the column for that
grade must be met. Failing grade (F) is given if all the requirements
for a “D” are not met. If the total number of assignments of a given
type is changed due to scheduling or other issues, this table will be
updated.</p>

<h4 id="bottom-line">Bottom line</h4>
<p>If you master half of the <em>Learning Targets</em>, show some
evidence of being able to apply the basic skills, and stay reasonably
engaged in the class, you can expect to pass the class with a grade of
“C”. Students who aspire to earn an “A” must master nearly all LTs
(including all CORE), consistently show they can apply basic skills to
solve <em>Integrated Problems</em>, and stay consistently engaged and
prepared for class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!CAUTION] CORE Learning Targets are the most important. Failing to
earning <em>Master</em> on all <code>CORE</code> LTs will result in one
letter grade reduction (for example from B to C). The numbers for the
<em>Learning Targets</em> column refer to the number of LTs for which
you earn <em>Master</em> rating (shown in Canvas as <code>2</code>).
Marks of <em>Proficient</em> (<code>1</code>) or <em>Beginner</em>
<strong>do not count</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="borderline-cases">Borderline cases</h4>
<p>With nearly 40 students in the class, each on a different path to the
final grade, it sometimes happens that a student completes almost all
requirements (all except for one). I will use my professional judgment
and look at the student’s engagement and effort and leave an option of
assigning a grade that is higher (but never lower) than the syllabus
indicates. Therefore, it is to your benefit to show that you are engaged
and invested in achieving learning objectives of the course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT] Higher score in one category cannot be used as argument
to “prop-up” insufficient score in another category. For example,
earning <em>Master</em> on more LT Problems will not compensate for
lower score on Integrated Problems. Also, you don’t have to do it all.
If you aim for “A”, you <strong>do not</strong> have to complete
<em>every</em> Learning Target.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="why-i-think-this-is-a-better-approach-to-grading">Why I think
this is a better approach to grading</h3>
<p>The grading system outlined above may be unusual, but in my view has
several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many assignments can be revised or reattempted if you need to
improve your work (<a href="#revisions-and-reattempts">see the next
section below</a>), and once you have demonstrated <em>Mastery</em> on a
<em>Learning Target</em>, <em>Integrated Problem</em>, you do not have
to revisit it again in the course. It’s possible that if you do well on
the Checkpoints, you will only need to work a fraction of the final
exam. Many times, students just opt out of the final altogether if they
have strong performances throughout the semester.</li>
<li>If you’re off to a shaky start and your marks early in the semester
are poor, you have time to practice and improve and past results don’t
hurt your final grade.</li>
<li>The final letter grade is like a score in a video game—it stay the
same or goes up.</li>
<li>Points, statistics, and unethical approaches such as grading on a
curve are not involved. Your grade is tracked with a checklist.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main downside of this grading system is that it can be
complicated and convoluted. The section about grading is by far the
longest part of this syllabus. In my experience, however, most students
“get it” after a few weeks, and I am always happy to clarify the
situation.</p>
<p>As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that <em>learning takes
time</em> and that grading your work based on a single point of data,
such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps
unethical. A truly valid measure of learning has to involve <em>multiple
attempts</em> that allow you to learn from (and correct) your past
mistakes and demonstrate not only your skill, but also your growth. I
believe you should not be penalized for having a bad day that results in
a bad test score, so long as you can show evidence that you’ve
<em>eventually</em> learned what you need to learn. Course learning
objectives are phrased as “at the end of the course the student should
be able to…”. Thus, nothing is final until the end of the course.</p>
<h3 id="note-on-canvas-gradebook">Note on Canvas Gradebook</h3>
<p>Canvas developers insist that assignments have point value which goes
against my grading philosophy. You will notice that Canvas assignments
have point values and will say something like “This assignment does not
count toward the final grade”. <strong>Ignore this statement.</strong>
It means that it is not included in the total point count you see in the
gradebook because we don’t use points-based grading. <em>Numbers are
used as marks that indicate progress</em>.</p>

<h4 id="integrated-problems">Integrated Problems</h4>
<p>You can revise and resubmit each Integrated Problem once (total of
two attempts). Your initial attempt will get verbal or written feedback
on it, and you can use the feedback to make corrections and/or
improvements that are called for. Solutions are submitted on Canvas in
an assignment area; revisions are simply submitted to the same
assignment area as a new version.</p>
<p>Integrated Problems will come with a deadline for initial
submissions. You must submit a complete, good-faith effort on the
assignment prior to the deadline in order to be eligible to revise or
resubmit it. Examples of situations where revision would not be allowed
include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The assignment is not submitted at all before the deadline (In other
words you cannot “revise” an assignment you did not turn in).</li>
<li>The assignment is submitted but some parts of the problem are
skipped or omitted either partially or entirely, or includes responses
saying something like “I didn’t know how to do this part” but no
significant attempt at a solution.</li>
<li>The assignment is submitted but the work has significant issues or
errors throughout. This usually occurs when it is difficult to tell if
there is any understanding of the concepts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Revisions of Integrated Problems sets also have a deadline. No
revisions are accepted past that deadline. No revisions or reattempts on
any item are allowed after 11:59 pm PT on Sunday, December 8. This is
the beginning of the last week of classes, and no revisions or
reattempts are allowed after that point so that the queue of items to
grade can be cleared prior to the finals week.</p>
<h2 id="getting-help">Getting help</h2>
<p>As mentioned, you will almost certainly find yourself lost, stuck, or
confused on <em>something</em> in this course at some point. This is not
a defect in your character or intelligence; it’s a sign you are being
challenged, and you can turn that challenge into real growth by
<strong>seeking out help as soon as you need it</strong>. Make every
effort to get yourself unstuck and resolve your questions on your own
first. But then:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attend office hours and ask questions there.</strong> No
appointment needed.</li>
<li><a href="https://calendar.app.google/89WXddVpYZ5YwzMD6">Schedule an
appointment through Google Calendar</a> if drop-in hours don’t work for
you.</li>
<li><strong>Work with a classmate</strong> as long as you’re staying
within bounds on academic honesty above. In particular, working in
groups on Class Primer is a very good idea and will help keep you from
getting stuck at the beginning of a new concept.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructor-availability-and-message-responses">Instructor
availability and message responses</h2>
<p><strong>You can ask a question about anything at any time.</strong>
You have both the right and the responsibility to ask questions about
anything in the course you don’t fully understand, whether math or some
aspect of the syllabus or anything else. You can use email, office
hours, appointments, or grab me before or after class.</p>
<p>However, please note that I cannot always respond immediately to
messages. In particular <strong>I do not typically check email between
6:00pm and 8:00am on weeknights</strong>, and <strong>I do not typically
check email at all on weekends</strong> in order to prioritize time for
family and other non-work pursuits. That said,</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages sent on a weekday (Monday-Friday) before 3:00 pm will
likely get a response <em>the same day</em>.</li>
<li>Messages sent after 3:00 pm Monday-Thursday will get a response
<em>the next day</em>.</li>
<li>Messages sent after 3:00 pm on Fridays or on the weekend will get a
response <em>the following Monday</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please plan ahead for instructor availability.</strong> For
example if you have something to turn in on a Friday, and you send a
question by email after 3:00pm, my reply may not come in time to help
you; plan ahead for contingencies like this.</p>
<h2 id="course-policies">Course policies</h2>
<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h3>
<p>This course is subject to <a
href="https://studentaffairs.fresnostate.edu/studentconduct/academic-integrity/">Standards
of Student Conduct</a> and <a
href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/236.pdf">The
Code of Academic Integrity</a>. Every student has the responsibility of
reading and understanding these policies, especially the consequences
for engaging in academically dishonest activities.</p>
<p>None of these policies should be necessary because there’s no need to
be academically dishonest thanks to the revision/resubmission policy.
Rather than engage in academic dishonesty and putting your entire career
at risk, just turn in your best complete good-faith effort on
assignments. And then, if revisions are needed, you’ll typically get the
chance. The important thing in CHEM 128A is not the grade, it’s the
understanding and growth you get from engaging in a feedback loop on
your work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT] TL;DR When you submit work on an assignment in this
class, it must be your ideas and your voice, and not someone else’s or
those of an AI. Anything else is subject to strong penalties that are
required by the university.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any action or behavior that misrepresents one’s contributions to or
the results of any scholarly product submitted for credit, evaluation,
or dissemination will be considered academic misconduct. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cheating</em>: Attempting to use materials, information, or aids
that have not been authorized by the instructor for academic work.</li>
<li><em>Collusion</em>: Unauthorized collaboration with another person
in preparing academic assignments offered for credit, and collaboration
with another person to commit a violation of any section of the rules on
academic misconduct. Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are included in
the definition of “another person”.</li>
<li><em>Dual submission</em>: Submitting work that has been previously
graded, or is being submitted concurrently to more than one course,
without authorization from the instructor of the class to which the
student wishes to submit. (This especially applies to those who are
repeating CHEM 128A.)</li>
<li><em>Plagiarism</em>: Appropriation of, buying, receiving as a gift,
or obtaining by any means material that is attributable in whole or in
part to another source without any indication or citation of the
original source, including words, sentences, ideas, illustrations,
structure, computer code, and other expression or media, and presenting
that material as one’s own academic work being offered for credit or in
conjunction with a program, course, or degree requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that this is not a complete list; and note that
<strong>enabling others</strong> to engage in academic misconduct is a
form of academic misconduct.</p>
<p>In CHEM 128A, when you submit an item for grading, it must represent
<em>your</em> ideas and be written in <em>your</em> voice, however
flawed those may be. Your work cannot significantly consist of ideas or
wording from another person or from an AI tool. Specific guidelines for
each form of assignment are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Target problems</strong>: These are completed on
paper during a class meeting. No collaboration is allowed, and no notes
are allowed.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Problems</strong>: Sometimes these are extensions
of simpler problems that we do in groups during class, and you can use
the results of that collaboration. Otherwise, you are allowed to consult
with another person or an AI tool, if the issue pertains to
<strong>terminology</strong> used in the problem, or very high-level
discussions about <strong>what the problem is asking for</strong>. But
no collaboration with people or AI is allowed on any question or
strategy that involves actually solving the problem. In other words, you
cannot ask AI tool to tell you “Howe to solve the problem”.</li>
<li><strong>Class Primer and iClicker</strong>: You’re allowed, actually
encouraged, to collaborate freely with others on these as long as you
are obeying the general rule that the work you turn in is your ideas and
your voice. If there is ever an exception, you’ll be told in
advance.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have no interest in creating a police state in my courses. But I am
obliged to investigate any evidence I perceive in which a student is
submitting work that does not faithfully represent their own
understanding. This investigation may involve discussions about the work
or a request to reproduce the work or something like it, in a
face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p>You can ask me (Dr. M.) any question you want, about anything, at any
time. Getting help from the professor is not academic dishonesty! In
case I cannot answer a question because it would reveal spoilers for the
solution, I’ll tell you so and it will be no big deal. Asking a question
will never be held against you.</p>
<h3 id="attendance-and-participation">Attendance and participation</h3>
<p>Attendance is expected at all class meetings. The pace of the course
is such that missing a class will result in falling behind almost
immediately, and it’s very hard to recover. iClicker credits are the
incentive to attend classes regularly. Participation is an essential
element of attendance. As mentioned before, the class is designed using
flipped learning model where the majority of in-class time is spent on
active participation, as opposed to passive observation of the
instructor lecturing from slides.</p>
<h3 id="absences">Absences</h3>
<p>Student absences (planned, unplanned, and for University-sponsored
activities) will be handled according to the <a
href="https://academics.fresnostate.edu/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf"><em>Policy
on Student Absences (APM 232)</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you must be absent, you do not need prior permission or
justification, but a notification will be appreciated. However,
<em>please avoid any non-essential absences</em> such as skipping class,
or scheduling a vacation during a day where class is scheduled. If you
miss, you are solely responsible for catching up. Missing a class
meeting may also mean missing a Checkpoint. In most cases, you will have
an opportunity to attempt the problem at the next Checkpoint.</p>
<h3 id="deadlines-and-late-work">Deadlines and late work</h3>
<p>Deadlines for Class Primers, and Integrated Problems are listed on
Canvas. In cases of apparent conflict between dates (different date on a
description page and different in the calendar), always assume that the
Course Calendar is right.</p>
<h3 id="technology-issues-when-submitting-work">Technology issues when
submitting work</h3>
<p>It is the student’s responsibility to make sure these items are
submitted on time, even if technology issues arise. Technology issues
that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be
considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you
are trying to upload work to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file,
you should try again later, use different browser, upload to Google
Drive and share a private link or send the file as an email attachment
until you can upload it successfully.</p>
<h3 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>Students are prohibited from any unauthorized recording,
dissemination, or publication of any academic presentation, including
any online classroom instruction, for any commercial purpose. In
addition, students may not record or use virtual/online instruction in
any manner that would violate copyright law. Students are to use all
online/virtual instruction exclusively for the educational purpose of
the online class in which the instruction is being provided. Students
may not re-record any online recordings or post any online recordings on
any other format (e.g., electronic, video, social media, audio
recording, web page, internet, hard paper copy, etc.) for any purpose
without the explicit written permission of the faculty member providing
the instruction. Exceptions for disability-related accommodations will
be addressed by Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) working in
conjunction with the student and faculty member.</p>
<h3 id="dropping-the-course">Dropping the course</h3>
<p>Dates and details on withdrawing from courses are described on the <a
href="http://fresnostate.edu/studentaffairs/are/registration/add-drop-deadlines.html">Admissions
web pages</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>serious and compelling reason</em> is defined as an unexpected
condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that
unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student’s ability to attend
class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be
acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the
department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the
appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that
substantiates the condition. Failing or performing poorly in a class is
not an acceptable “serious and compelling reason” within the University
policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or
instructor.</p>
<h3 id="university-policies-and-disclaimers">University policies and
disclaimers</h3>
<p>In addition to course policies, you are expected to be familiar with
Academic Regulations described in the <a
