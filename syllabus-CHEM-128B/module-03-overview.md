The goals of this module is to learn how to

* R2: Predict products, infer substrates, and propose reagents needed to complete a reaction scheme involving ethers, sulfides, and epoxides; and
* M2: Use curved arrow notation to depict plausible reaction mechanisms that involve ethers, sulfides, and epoxides.

### Review

As you read chapter 13 you will notice that chemistry of ethers was discussed before and there are a lot of cross-references to prior chapters: 

* Reading Energy Diagrams (Section 6.06)
* SN2 Reactions (Sections 7.03, 7.04)
* Halohydrin Formation (Section 8.09)
* Mechanisms and Curved Arrows (Sections 6.08-6.11)
* Oxymercuration-Demercuration (Section 8.06)

Although these topics are included in the learning objectives, we will not spend significant amount of time on them. Synthesis of ethers was discussed in CHEM 128A (Chapter 7 and Chapter 8). My good friend James has a good [overview of how ethers are made][5] and [how to plan synthesis of ethers][6] (including common pitfalls of synthetic planning).
