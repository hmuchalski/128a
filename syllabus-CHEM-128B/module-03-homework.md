We finished discussing the chemistry of ethers and epoxides as well as their sulfur analogs. Chemistry of epoxides is a very [difficult landscape to navigate][1] and that's because they are very strained rings and there is a big energetic gain in opening the ring and releasing the strain. There are reactions where the focus is the Lewis-basic oxygen but on the other hand there are Lewis-acidic (electrophilic) carbons. Opening of epoxides is governed by different rules depending on whether the ring-opening reaction is [acid-catalyzed][2] or [base-catalyzed][3].
