\hypertarget{start-here}{%
\section{Start here}\label{start-here}}

Welcome to the second semester of course in organic chemistry (CHEM
128B)! I'm Hubert Muchalski, a professor in the Chemistry Department.
Before reading any further, here are some things to know:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{I want you to be successful in this course.} I will do my
  utmost to help you do this, by creating and maintaining a learning
  environment based on challenge and support. ``Success'' in the course
  is more than just good grades. It means that you are being
  \textbf{challenged} to grow as a learner, that you are
  \textbf{engaging actively} with tasks that feed your growth, and that
  you are creating \textbf{excellent work} by solving challenging
  organic chemistry problems. It also means that you are
  \textbf{building your lifelong learning skills} so that once the
  course is over, you are better and stronger as a learner and can
  continue to learn new things independently.
\item
  \textbf{College-level chemistry is more than just memorizing
  structures and reactions.} On the pathway to ``success'' as outlined
  above, you will be asked to do more than just give answers to
  problems. Your task is to \textbf{seek deep understanding} of
  underlying concepts and working on explaining of the outcomes of
  chemical reactions and properties of organic molecules.
\item
  \textbf{Expect to be challenged intellectually throughout this
  course.} None of these elements of ``success'' come easily. They
  require dedicated devotion of time and energy to wrestling with the
  concepts and tasks in the course. This will require you to leave your
  comfort zones on a regular basis. You will need to stay engaged by
  participating in class meetings and on the class discussion
  board---asking questions, seeking understanding, and giving help.
\item
  \textbf{Intellectual struggle is normal and healthy in a challenging
  course.} Since none of this is easy, you can expect at times to feel
  like you are really struggling with the material, even if in your
  earlier chemistry courses you might never have experienced struggle.
  \textbf{This is a normal and healthy experience.} Legitimate struggle
  is actually a sign you are doing things right, and it's a signal
  you're about to experience explosive growth. My goal is to provide
  \textbf{a safe place for you to experience those struggles.}
\item
  \textbf{You have a lot of help available to you as you work.}
  Throughout the semester, you will be challenged but also given a lot
  of support to help you rise to the challenge. I will be readily
  available to help in several channels; your classmates will be
  available for help through structured and informal support groups.
  \textbf{Everyone in the course has your back.}
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\subsection{Learning objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}

In this course we will continue to explore one of the richest and most
beautiful areas of modern chemistry: \emph{chemistry of carbon-based
compounds}. This course is required for majors in life and physical
sciences because it covers topics and concepts that are essential for
understanding of biochemistry and medicine. Upon successful completion
of this course you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Communicate the structure and properties using drawing and naming
  conventions introduced in CHEM 128A
\item
  Analyze electronic structure of molecules to make and defend
  predictions about their properties.
\item
  Predict products, infer substrates, and propose reagents needed to
  complete a chemical reactions.
\item
  Use curved arrow notation to depict plausible reaction mechanisms.
\item
  Use spectroscopic data to deduce the structure of the molecule.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{This course uses a different grading system} to ones that you
experienced in other courses and the details are explained in the
sections below. \emph{Please read the entire syllabus carefully,} it is
nearly 4,000 words for a reason. Almost all questions about the course
that you might ask, can be answered by referencing the syllabus. If you
are uncertain that you understand all rules and regulations, please
contact me.

\hypertarget{course-materials}{%
\subsection{Course materials}\label{course-materials}}

This course is part of the Immediate Access program. All students have
access to a digital version of the textbook and associated materials on
the first day of class. Students who wish to purchase course materials
on their own, have \emph{until the 10th day of instruction to opt-out}.
Students are automatically charged on the 10th day (5th day for Summer
courses) to continue to have access to course materials for the rest of
term. More info can be found at
\url{https://als.csuprojects.org/immediate_access_programs}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Canvas:} The central repository for all course materials and
  information found here: \url{https://fresnostate.instructure.com}.
\item
  \textbf{Textbook:} ``Organic Chemistry'' online textbook with
  integrated Study Guide and Solutions Manual by David Klein 3rd edition
  published by Wiley (via Immediate Access).
\item
  \textbf{WileyPLUS with ORION:} Online learning platform and homework.
  WileyPLUS is integrated with Canvas and all links to assignments and
  materials will be posted on Canvas. \footnote{WileyPLUS version is
    tied to the edition of the textbook. If you opt out of Immediate
    Access and buy the textbook and access to WileyPLUS through other
    means, make sure that your access code is for the 3rd edition of the
    textbook}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{technology}{%
\subsection{Technology}\label{technology}}

To use the course tools, you will need to have access to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{A personal computer}: running Windows or macOS, that can run
  desktop applications and has a reliable access to high-speed internet.
  A tablet device is an acceptable alternative, but the online homework
  platform doesn't work as well on mobile devices.
\item
  \textbf{A modern web browser}: Chrome is recommended by campus IT, but
  browsers such as Edge, Firefox, or Safari are also fine.
\item
  \textbf{Zoom:} Virtual class meetings will be held via Zoom. Links and
  passwords to zoom meetings will be published on Canvas.
\item
  \textbf{Document scanning tool}: Many assignments in this course are
  designed to be prepared by hand on paper. Few people own document
  scanners nowadays, but a mobile device with a scanning app can do a
  sufficient job at converting paper documents into PDFs. There are
  number of options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that
  you like and learn how to use it.
\item
  \textbf{Active Fresno State network account} so that you can access
  email, Canvas, and Google Suite
\end{itemize}

If you have any issue with accessing any of the above, please let me
know as soon as possible. We will use a variety of additional course
tools during the semester, but they will be free to use, and you will be
taught how to use them as part of the class.

\textbf{Course content:} We will cover chapters 12-22 of the
\emph{Organic Chemistry} text. Key topics to be studied include:
understanding how structure determines function and reactivity of
organic molecules. In every topic, we seek a \textbf{conceptual
understanding} from several perspectives, the ability to \textbf{apply
ideas}, development of \textbf{logical reasoning and communication
skills}, and an \textbf{appreciation for organic chemistry as a whole}.

\hypertarget{structure-of-the-course}{%
\section{Structure of the course}\label{structure-of-the-course}}

This CHEM 128B course is being offered in a virtual flipped mode.
``Flipped'' means that the course is a combination of synchronous
(on-Zoom) and asynchronous (off-Zoom) work. The content is divided into
\protect\hyperlink{modules}{12 modules}, generally following the
chapters in the textbook. Your work in the class will follow a repeating
pattern that will involve you before, during, and after our Zoom
meetings.

\textbf{Before each class,} your task will be to review previously
covered material, and get familiar with the basic concepts of the
upcoming lesson through guided reading, video, or exercises on new
concepts. Not all material needs formal instruction. Some sections are a
review of concepts from prior chapters, others present new content which
not difficult to learn on your own. Take notes and write down questions
you have while engaging in self-directed learning. You will have an
opportunity to ask them in class.

\textbf{Each class meeting,} which is only 50 minutes, we will begin
with 10 min period for going over the pre-class material and fielding
your questions. Then we will spend most of the class (\textasciitilde30
minutes) doing activities together on the harder concepts from the
material. There may be some small lectures, but active work will be the
main event since the best way to learn organic chemistry is by doing
lots of problems! The remaining time (\textasciitilde10 min) will be for
reviewing the main points of the lesson.

\textbf{After each class,} you will engage with the material through the
ongoing work: online homework to practice the ideas from the module
(WileyPLUS); Application/Extension problems that take your basic skills
to the next level: and Checkpoints given roughly every other week that
assess your mastery of basic skills.

\hypertarget{zoom-meetings}{%
\subsection{Zoom meetings}\label{zoom-meetings}}

We will have online conference calls on the days/times the class is
scheduled. The sessions will be recorded, although many activities will
happen in small breakout rooms and those aren't part of the recording.
It is in your interest to attend live class meetings.

\hypertarget{learning-activities-in-chem-128b}{%
\section{Learning activities in CHEM
128B}\label{learning-activities-in-chem-128b}}

You will be engaging with several different kinds of activities in the
course, both to facilitate learning of the material and to demonstrate
how well you have learned it. Our course uses a \emph{mastery-based
grading system} in which many graded items do not use points, but rather
your work will be required to meet certain levels of quality that
demonstrate \emph{mastery}. We will discuss this several times in class,
and there is more information later in this document.

The kinds of activities you will undertake are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Learning Target Assessments (LTA)} are short tests assessing
  student learning within one learning objective. Throughout the
  semester, you will be asked to provide evidence that you mastered the
  skills and concepts that by completing short quizzes, each addressing
  a single Learning Target. LTAs are graded either \emph{satisfactory}
  or \emph{progressing} and no partial credit is awarded. See
  \protect\hyperlink{grading}{``How work is graded in CHEM 128B''} below
  for details.
\item
  \textbf{Application/Extension Problems (AEP)} are more challenging
  integrated problems for which students must to clearly communicate a
  complete solution. AEPs assesses student skills across multiple
  learning objectives, may require technology, and all will require a
  formal writeup. AEPs are graded using the EMRN rubric discussed in
  \protect\hyperlink{grading}{``How work is graded in CHEM 128B''} and
  can be revised and resubmitted if needed.
\item
  \textbf{Preparation, practice, and participation (PPP)} category
  includes points earned on online pre-class assignments and online
  homework (WileyPLUS) as well as participation during lecture. It is in
  your interest to complete pre-class assignments because the results
  guide my decisions about what activities to plan and what concepts to
  focus on in the upcoming class meeting.
\item
  \textbf{Module Portfolio (MP)} is a collection of notes and other
  content you generated while studying and practicing the topics
  discussed in each module.
\item
  \textbf{Final exam} will be on \textbf{Monday, December 14th,
  08:45--10:45 AM}. Final exam is composed of 70 multiple choice
  questions designed by experts from the American Chemical Society. The
  final exam will be administered online via Canvas and the Respondus
  Lockdown Browser.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{mastery-checkpoints}{%
\subsection{Mastery Checkpoints}\label{mastery-checkpoints}}

Roughly every 3 weeks, I will post \emph{Mastery Checkpoint}, an exam
packet of LTAs, each one of which focuses on a single Learning Target
from the list in the \protect\hyperlink{appendix-a}{Appendix A}. Each
\textbf{Checkpoint} will contain one LTA that has been covered up to
that point. For example, the first \textbf{Checkpoint} may contain
problems for Learning Targets E1, R1, R2, M1, M2; the second
\textbf{Checkpoint} will contain new versions of E1, R1, R2, M1, M2
along with first-time problems for S1 through S3; and so on. \textbf{You
will only need to attempt problems for Learning Targets that you have
not yet mastered}. The cumulative structure allows you to attempt
problems multiple times in different weeks. Students will be provided
with a detailed rubric for what constitutes acceptable work on each LTA.
Work that meets the criteria will be given a \emph{satisfactory} grade
and will be considered \textbf{mastered}. Work that does not meet the
criteria will receive an \emph{progressing} grade and can be redone at
any later \textbf{Checkpoint} (see the \href{revisions}{Revision} policy
for details.

You can also show that you mastered the material through means other
than \textbf{Checkpoints}, but no more than 3 LTAs per semester, and no
more than one LTA per week, can be attempted through the following
options:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Option 1}: Schedule an oral assessment (via videoconference)
  during which I will give a new version of a \textbf{Checkpoint}-like
  LTA, and you solve that problem ``live'' at an acceptable level.
\item
  \textbf{Option 2}: Create a video of yourself working out the solution
  to a \textbf{Checkpoint}-like LTA that I will make for you, then
  submit the video. If you choose this option, you'll also be required
  to have a follow-up video meeting with me to discuss the solution and
  answer additional related questions to make sure you really understand
  the ideas. The video must adhere to standards for video creation
  (posted separately; basically the video must have clear audio, and
  keep face, handwriting, and voice in the frame at all times).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-emrn-rubric}{%
\subsection{The EMRN rubric}\label{the-emrn-rubric}}

Work on Application/Extension Problems is graded not with points but
with one of four designation: ``E'' (Excellent/Exemplary), ``M'' (Meets
the standard), ``R'' (Needs revision), or ``N'' (Not assessible/Not
enough information). Whenever your work on an AEP is graded, you will be
given extensive actionable feedback on what was done well and what needs
improvement. The process of assigning these marks is shown below:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{emrn.png}
\caption{EMRN rubric}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{grading}{%
\section{How work is graded in CHEM 128B}\label{grading}}

CHEM 128B uses a mastery-based grading system that is designed to
provide you with control over the grading process. The final grade in
CHEM 128B will be determined by the quantity and quality of evidence you
provide that show you have mastered the course learning objectives.
There are 24 Learning Targets in the course, 10 of which are designated
as \textbf{Core} targets due to their central nature in Organic
Chemistry, and the other 14 of which are designated as
\textbf{Supplemental}. Students get numerous opportunities to
demonstrate mastery of the content described in Learning Targets.

\hypertarget{final-letter-grade}{%
\subsection{Final letter grade}\label{final-letter-grade}}

Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to earn
a particular letter grade, each requirement must be met in the column
for that grade, \textbf{the highest grade for which all the requirements
are met}. There are no statistical or numerical adjustments (a.k.a.
grading on a curve). Failing grade (F) is given if not all the
requirements for a ``D'' are met.

Note: In the table, numerical values indicate the minimum level needed
to meet the requirement; amounts above this level also meet the
requirement. For AEP's, ``M+'' means ``either M or E''.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
Category & D & C & B & A\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Core Learning Targets (10) & 5 & 10 & 10 & 10\tabularnewline
Supplemental Learning Targets (14) & 5 & 6 & 9 & 12\tabularnewline
AEPs (8+) & 1 M+ & 2 M+ & 2 E, 4 M+ & 4E, 2 M+\tabularnewline
Module Portfolio (12) & 4 & 6 & 8 & 10\tabularnewline
PPP (1000+) & 500 & 800 & 800 & 800\tabularnewline
Final Exam & 20\% & 30\% & 40\% & 50\%\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{revisions}{%
\subsection{Revisions and tokens}\label{revisions}}

The mastery-based grading system insists that you show consistent
excellence in all assignments in the course. Outstanding work on
homework, for example, does not ``bring up'' poor work on LTAs. LTAs can
be revised by reattempting the item on a later \emph{Checkpoint} or
through one of the other means described earlier.

AEPs earning M, R, or N can be revised and resubmitted at any time. They
will be regraded using the same standards as originally used. However,
there are two important limitations on your revision and resubmission of
AEP's:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  No more than two submissions of AEP sets may be made per week. This
  can be two new sets, two revisions, or one of each. A third submission
  can be purchased with a \protect\hyperlink{tokens}{token} (below) but
  four or more submissions in a week are not allowed under any
  cirumstance.
\item
  Revision of N grades rule: Students have to spend a token (below) in
  order to revise any AEP that was graded at ``N'' (Not Assessable).
\end{enumerate}

Scores for WileyPLUS assignments are final. If you do not get a
percentage correct to show mastery (\textgreater75\%), you can reset the
assignment and try again until the deadline.

\hypertarget{tokens}{%
\subsection{Tokens}\label{tokens}}

Tokens are a fake currency that are used to ``purchase'' exceptions to
course policies and other advantageous items in the course. Every
student starts with five of these. One token can be spent for any of the
following at any time:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Attempt a second Learning Target in a given week through
  non-\emph{Checkpoint} means
\item
  Submit a third AEP (either revision or new submission) in a given week
\item
  Revise an AEP graded ``N''
\item
  Extend the deadline on a \emph{Checkpoint} by 2 hours (request must be
  submitted prior to the original deadline)
\end{itemize}

To spend a token, please use the \emph{Token Spending form} found on
Canvas. Tokens may not be ``stacked''. For example, by spending 3 tokens
to get a 6-hour \emph{Checkpoint} deadline extension.

\hypertarget{course-policies}{%
\section{Course policies}\label{course-policies}}

\hypertarget{technology-issues-when-submitting-work}{%
\subsection{Technology issues when submitting
work}\label{technology-issues-when-submitting-work}}

WileyPLUS and ORION assignments are submitted electronically. It is the
student's responsibility to make sure these items are submitted on time,
even if technology issues arise. Technology issues that are avoidable or
resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds
for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab
to Canvas and Canvas won't accept the file, you should try again later,
use different browser, or send the file as an email attachment until you
can upload it successfully.

\hypertarget{academic-integrity}{%
\subsection{Academic integrity}\label{academic-integrity}}

Some of the work you will do in the course involves collaboration; at
other times collaboration may be allowed but not required; while at
others it may not be allowed. Here are the rules for collaboration on
each kind of work you do:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Checkpoints} and other work done on Learning Targets: No
  interations at all with another person or with unauthorized sources on
  the internet is allowed. Any evidence of using information from
  another person or source will be investigated as academic dishonesty.
\item
  \emph{AEPs}: Similarly, no interations at all with another person or
  with unauthorized sources on the internet is allowed.
\item
  \emph{WileyPLUS}: You may discuss the general, broad ideas of WeBWorK
  problems with others but you may not use other people's work as your
  own.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Please note:} There is no need to commit academic dishonesty in
this class since you can revise and resubmit almost anything. If you
come to believe that cheating or plagiarism is necessary given your
situation: DON'T DO IT. Get some help instead and take comfort in the
fact that you can just submit your best effort, get feedback, and try
again later.

All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be thoroughly
investigated, and whether a student has committed academic dishonesty is
my determination to make based on the evidence. If I determine academic
dishonesty has been committed, a report will be filed with the Dean of
Students office, and the minimum penalty will be:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  grade of ``progressing'' on Checkpoints and other Learning Target work
  and required expense of two tokens to reattempt; for severe cases, you
  may be barred from reattempting.
\item
  AEP's: A grade of ``N'', and you will not be allowed to revise or
  resubmit the AEP for the rest of the semester.
\end{itemize}

Note these are \emph{minimum} penalties. Academic dishonesty carries
with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State policies,
including possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from
the university. For details, please see APM 235 by going to
\url{http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf}.

\hypertarget{dropping-the-course}{%
\subsection{Dropping the course}\label{dropping-the-course}}

Dates and details on withdrawing from courses are described on the
\href{http://fresnostate.edu/studentaffairs/are/registration/add-drop-deadlines.html}{Admissions
web pages}.

A \emph{serious and compelling reason} is defined as an unexpected
condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that
unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend
class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be
acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the
department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the
appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that
substantiates the condition. Failing or performing poorly in a class is
not an acceptable ``serious and compelling reason'' within the
University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class
or instructor.
