# How to achieve course goals

The work assigned in this course is designed to help you achieve course learning objectives. Learning is a constructive process, rather then simple transfer of knowledge. Prior to the class meeting, students are required to work actively to get their first contact with new concepts by reading the textbook, watching videos, and completing the pre-class assignments and homework (WileyPLUS). During the synchronous meetings we will learn through group problem-solving activities, discussions driven by classroom response systems, and more. After class meeting, students should regularly study the material by doing practice problems, completing online homework, and other assignments (approximately 9 hours per week). 

# Types of graded work

There are three kinds of assignments and tests that you will encounter in this course:

1. Learning Target Assessments (LTAs).  
2. Mini-projects are integrated problems for which students must to clearly communicate a solution that. Mini-projects assesses student skills across multiple learning objectives.
3. Preparation, participation, and Practice (PPP) category includes pre-class assignments and online homework (WileyPLUS) as well as participation during lecture (iClicker). 
4. Final Exam.

A complete listing of the criteria used to assign grades to these items is found in [Appendix A, “Grading Standards”](#rubrics). 

## Learning target assessments (LTAs)

LTAs are short (4-5 problems) tests assessing student learning within one module-level learning objective. Throughout the semester, you will be asked to provide evidence that you mastered the skills and concepts that by completing short quizzes, each addressing a single Learning Target. The quizzes, called Learning Target Assessments, or LTAs, are graded either *satisfactory* or *progressing*. *Satisfactory* mark is earned when at least  What constitutes *satisfactory* or *progressing* work will be spelled out explicitly for each Learning Target and made known to you in advance. 

Each attempt requires a token ([see section below](#tokens) for more details). Students can attempt LTAs during in-class sessions, during office hours, or by appoinment. LTAs can be attempted multiple times. There are mechanisms set in place to encourage/force you to maintain reasonable progress on your portfolio throughout the semester and not to procrastinate, and also to keep the grading workload small enough that I can get feedback to you quickly. Check section on [Reasessment](#revisions) below for details. 

are short (4-5 problems) tests assessing student learning within one module-level learning objective.

## Preparation-class assignments (WileyPLUS)

This class is designed according to a model in which pre-class readings, videos, and Skill Builder problems provide you with a structured introduction to the basic ideas of new material so that we can review, discuss, and practice concepts during in-class meetings. By completing the pre-class assignment you get the idea of proficiency you achieved from reading the textbook, watching online videos, etc. The collective results guide my decisions about what activities to plan and what concepts to focus on in the upcoming class meetings. 

## Online homework (WileyPLUS)

This assignment requires that you show that you mastered the material. You can attempt each question only once, but if you do not get a percentage correct to show mastery, you can reset the assignment and try again. Resetting the assignment will generate a new set of questions, but will not change the level of difficulty. Your most recent attempt will be the recorded score. Details and deadlines for submitting online homework will be listed on WileyPLUS.



## Take-home assignments

Students who aspire to receive the highest grade in this course and/or consider using me as a reference for their graduate/professional school applications will be asked to earn *satisfactory* grade on additional take-home assignments on spectroscopy, synthesis, and other special topics. 

## Final examination

Final exam will be on **Wednesday, May 15th, 08:45–10:45 AM**. Final exam is composed of 70 multiple choice questions designed by experts from the American Chemical Society.

## Participation

You will also have opportunity to earn *participation credits (PC)*. A participation credit will be awarded for participation in clicker questions or asking an insightful question in class or during office hours. Some additional participation credit opportunities may be announced in advance.

Research shows that student response systems (clickers) help students learn more and do better in the course. I have successfully used the student response system to gauge student learning and direct the flow of the lecture. Student polling will be used in almost every lecture and students must respond to at least 75% of questions on a particular day to earn PC for participation in the session. 

# How your course grade is determined

CHEM 128B uses a mastery-based grading system that is designed to provide you with control over the grading process. Your course grade in CHEM 128B will be determined by the quantity and quality of evidence you can provide that you have mastered the concepts of the course. At the beginning of the semester, you will be able to decide on the target grade you plan to earn for the course. This can be an “A”, “B”, or even a “C”, depending on your circumstance. 

**You will have multiple attempts to earn a *satisfactory* grade on majority of key assignments**. The grading system in this course allows revisions and multiple attempts to demonstrate a *satisfactory* level of learning. Grades on LTAs are not ﬁnal until the end of the semester because quizzes can be attempted again. [Quiz retake policy](#revisions) is described in more detail below (see [Course Policies](#course-policies) section).
 
## Final letter grade

The grade you earn at the end of the semester is determined by refering to table below. There are no statistical or numerical adjust (a.k.a. grading on a curve). All items within “grade bundle” must be completed to receive the letter grade.  Failing grade (F) is given if not all the requirements for a "D" are met.

### "D" Bundle

## Reassessment {#revisions}

The grading system in our course insists that you show consistent excellence in all assignments in the course---outstanding work on homework, for example, does not “bring up” poor work on LTAs. This can be challenging, but the course also provides a robust system of revision and reassessment for most graded tasks, so that if you aren’t happy with a grade on an assignment, you’ll have multiple chances to try again or fix any mistakes. 

Scores for WileyPLUS "Mastery" homework are final. If you do not get a percentage correct to show mastery (>75%), you can reset the assignment and try again until the deadline. 

Students can request reassessment for any unsuccessful LTAs. Each additional attempt will cover the same material and have similar problems but will not be identical to past quizzes. Students can attempt up to three LTAs during a reassessment session or up to two LTAs during a single office hour visit. The 20-minute of LTA is firm and no extra time will be allowed. 
To request a (re)assessment, student must reserve an appointment on Canvas (look for "Find Appointments" feature in Calendar).

I found that students tend to defer LTAs until it's too late. Thus, if an attempt at passing a chapter LTA occurs later then 3 weeks after covering it in class (first attempt) or 3 weeks after previous unsuccesful attempt, it will cost two [tokens](#tokens). 

If you receive either a *Progressing* or *Incomplete* mark, you will receive feedback on your work, and you can use the feedback to make corrections and then resubmit your work for regrading. You may submit up to one revision per week. 

## Tokens

Tokens are a “currency” in the course that you use to purchase LTA attempts, assignment regrades, and exceptions to some course rules. Each student begins the course with 20 tokens, and tokens can purchase any of the following:

* one token buys one attempt at passing one LTA;
* one token buys 24-hour deadline extension for online "Mastery" homework;
* two tokens buy one attempt at one LTA beyond the three week window;
* two tokens buy one participation credit; and
* three tokens buy ORION proficiency meter reset.

# What are my expectations?

**I want you to be successful in this course.** I will do my utmost to help you do this, by creating and maintaining a learning environment based on challenge and support and giving my highest professional commitment to your success and well-being. But, **I cannot achieve success for you**. Success in college courses comes from cooperation with instructors, interaction with your classmates, and diligent effort throughout the semester. I like to compare successful classroom interactions to interactions between players and coaches on a sports team. Players do the work and coaches make sure players do the work that helps players succeed.

To be successful in the course, you need to make sure you are always giving an effort to do the following:

* Prepare for the class through the pre-class learning exercises (Skill Builder).
* Attend all class meetings and participate in class activities.
* Be proactive in completing course work and avoid procrastination in all things.
* Maintain awareness of course announcements and calendar events, by regularly checking email, and the course calendar.
* Take initiative to seek out help when you are stuck or have a question by using office visits, SI, study groups, and whatever else works for you.
* Maintain a positive attitude about the class and what you are learning.

There are many strategies to study Organic Chemistry. The hardest and one I don't recommend is rote memorization. There will be a lot of new words, definitions, names, and structures that you will have to commit to memory. Memorizing *everything*, however, is nearly impossible because the amount of material that is covered increases dramatically as the semester progresses. Understanding of the trends, principles, connections, and logic of chemical transformation will give you better chances of success. 

## Expectations for professor

My primary responsibility is to create a learning environment where it’s safe to take risks and make mistakes, without shaming or judgment, and to give you feedback and guidance as you grow in your understanding of the subject. As my students, you have a right to expect from me: 

- carefully designed and executed learning activities both in and out of class; 
- informative feedback on, and timely return of all graded work (I strive to return all graded work within one week of your turning it in);
- timely responses to all communications; and 
- respectful, professional treatment in all personal interactions. 

If you perceive that I am falling short in any of these expectations, you have the right and responsibility to give constructive feedback that helps me improve. I will consider all reasonable suggestions in the course regarding my instruction or the course design. 

## Supplemental Instruction

Supplemental Instruction (SI) is provided for all students who want to improve their understanding of the material taught in this course. SI sessions are led by a student who has already mastered the course material and has been trained to facilitate group sessions where students can meet to compare class notes, review and discussimportant concepts, develop strategies for studying, and prepare for exams. The SI leader attends this class and communicates regularly with the instructor to ensure that accurate information is given. Attendance at SI sessions is free and voluntary for any student enrolled in this course. Students may attend as many times as they choose. A session schedule will be announced in the first few weeks of class. Learn more by watching this video:  [http://youtu.be/yTLGu5TLOUI](http://youtu.be/yTLGu5TLOUI)

# Course policies

## Technology issues when submitting work

WileyPLUS and ORION assignments are submitted electronically. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure these items are submitted on time, through any means necessary, even if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises that prevents your being able to submit work on time, it is your responsibility to find another way to get it to me (for example, via an email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try again later or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.

## Recording of in-class content

Audio and video recordings of class lectures are prohibited unless I give you explicit permission to do it. Students with an official letter from the Services for Students with Disabilities office may record the class if SSD has approved that service.

## Academic Dishonesty

Your work on Learning Target Assessments must be done individually, and all collaboration is prohibited. 

For take-home assignments you are allowed and encouraged to work with others. However, the final product that you submit for feedback must be the result of your own efforts. Therefore, you may share ideas and strategies with others, but collaboration on the actual finished product you submit is not allowed. Your work is expected to be the product of your own thinking, written and explained in your own words with no parts of the work copied from external sources such as books or websites, and done clearly enough in your own mind that you could explain the work from start to finish if asked. Specifically, this excludes: 

- copying work from another student; 
- copying work from a website; 
- paraphrasing work done by another student or from print or internet resources---i.e. putting it in your own words---without coming up with the main ideas and strategies yourself; and 
- *allowing or enabling* another student to copy or paraphrase work that you did, even if you did the original work yourself. 

Violation of this policy is considered “academic dishonesty” and carries with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State, including possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the university. For details, please see APM 235 by going to [http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf](http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf). 

You may feel tempted to academic dishonesty at some point in the semester. The work can be difficult, and many of you are under a lot of stress. If you are considering academic dishonesty, please STOP, take a breath, and remember that your classmates and I want you to succeed in the course. You are not alone, and you have a strong network in the class for getting help. The revision and resubmission policies mean that it’s OK to turn in work that isn’t perfect. There is no need to be academically dishonest! Just do your best on the work, and you'll have the chance to revise it later.

## Dropping the course

Students may drop classes using the on-line system through Thursday, February. The Drop/Withdrawal Form, signed by instructor and department chair, is needed to drop a course after that date. Withdrawals processed before 9/20 will not show on the official transcript. Serious and compelling drop period begins on September 21 and ends on November 20. More details on [Admissions web pages](http://fresnostate.edu/studentaffairs/are/registration/add-drop-deadlines.html) 

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.

Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious and compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor. 

# University policies and disclaimers

In addition to course policies, you are expected to be familiar with Academic Regulations described in the [University Catalog](http://www.fresnostate.edu/catalog/academic-regulations/) as well as policies listed below.

# Appendix A: Grading rubrics {#rubrics}

- Pre-class ORION assignments are graded either *satisfactory* (S) or *unsatisfactory* (U) and are graded on the basis of completeness, effort, and timeliness. 

| Mark | Description |
|------|-------------|
| S | Completed initial diagnostic activity for the chapter. Every item on the assignment has a response that represents a good-faith effort to answer correctly; and the work is submitted before the deadline. |
| U | No work submitted; or work is submitted that is late, has at least one blank response, or at least one response that is not a serious attempt. |

- WileyPLUS Mastery assignments are typically 10 questions on a particular topic and require that you attempt each of the questions and get a total percentage correct. You can attempt each question only once, however if you do not get a percentage correct to show mastery (>75%), you can reset the assignment and try again. Resetting the assignment will generate a new set of questions for you to attempt. Your best attempt at this assignment will be your final recorded score. Resetting the assignment will not change the difficulty level of the questions. 75% or more correct to receive 10 points; 50% or more correct to receive 5 points; less than 50% correct to receive 0 points.
- Learning Target Assessments (LTAs) are graded either Satisfactory (S) or Progressing (P) using criteria spelled out individually for each target. 
- Take-home assignments are graded either Satisfactory (S), Progressing (P), or Incomplete (I). The base criteria for all assignments are as follows (some may have additional criteria which will be explained withing the assignment):


| Mark | Description |
|------|-------------|
| S | Understanding of the concepts is evident, although there may be a small number of mistakes in the work that do not significantly affect the overall reasoning. All solutions are backed up by work that is clearly shown and easy to read. |
| P | Partial understanding of concepts is evident, and all parts of the solution have a good-faith attempt. But there are significant errors in computation, logic, or writing that affect the overall reasoning. The work should be revised. |
| I | No work submitted or there are significant omissions in the work, such as parts of the solution left blank intentionally or essential parts of the reasoning behind the answers that are missing or unreadable. Not enough information to determine if the concepts are fully understood. |
