# TL;DR

-   I want you to succeed. Your classmates want you to succeed.
-   Organic chemistry is a hard subject to master, especially as an
    intense summer course.
-   This course is designed according to *flipped learning* model. It
    doesn't mean it is asynchronous.
-   This course uses mastery grading system. There are no points and no
    partial credit. Even if you took a class with me before, this
    implementation is different.
-   Your learning will be measured with quizzes (Learning Target
    problems), written assignments (AEPs), and a final exam (multiple
    choice ACS exam).
-   It doesn't matter what textbook you use but official text (Klein 4
    ed) has some perks and is easily obtained via Kennel Bookstore.
-   Course ends with a final exam on 7/19 at 9 am.
-   Don't cheat. Consequences are severe.

# Start here

Welcome to the second semester of organic chemistry course (CHEM 128B)!
I'm Hubert Muchalski, a professor in Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry. Before reading any further, here are some things to know:

1.  **I want you to be successful in this course.** I will do my utmost
    to help you do this, by creating and maintaining a learning
    environment based on challenge and support. "Success" in the course
    is more than just good grades. It means that you are being
    challenged to grow as a learner, that you are engaging actively with
    tasks that feed your growth, and that you are doing your best work
    by solving challenging organic chemistry problems. It also means
    that you are building your lifelong learning skills so that once the
    course is over, you are better and stronger as a learner and can
    continue to learn new things independently.
2.  **College-level chemistry is more than just memorizing structures
    and reactions**. On the pathway to success as outlined above, you
    will be asked to do more than just give answers to problems. Your
    task is to seek deep understanding of underlying concepts and
    working on explaining of the outcomes of chemical reactions and
    properties of organic molecules.
3.  **Expect to be challenged intellectually throughout this course.**
    None of these elements of success come easily. They require a great
    deal of time and attention to properly deal with ambiguity of the
    concepts and tasks in the course. This will require you to leave
    your comfort zones on a regular basis. You will need to stay engaged
    by participating in class meetings and on the class discussion
    board---asking questions, seeking understanding, and giving help.
4.  **Intellectual struggle is normal and healthy in a challenging
    course.** You can expect at times to feel like you are really
    struggling with the material, even if learning in earlier chemistry
    courses came easy. This is a normal and healthy experience.
    Legitimate struggle is actually a sign you are doing things right,
    training your mind beyond what it is capable at the moment. My goal
    is to support you in this process.
5.  **You have a lot of help available to you as you work.** Throughout
    the semester, you will be given a lot of support to help you rise to
    the challenge. I will do my best to be available for consultations.
    You're not alone in this so please engage with your classmates, ask
    questions, seek clarification but also be provide help whenever you
    can.

# Introduction

Carbon-based molecules are central to a host of chemical and biological
processes because of their broad range of structure and reactivity. The
millions of organic compounds alone, ranging from polymers to
pharmaceuticals, make the field important for study. Yet organic
chemistry is also a highly integrated discipline that impacts and is
impacted by the other branches of chemistry and other sciences. Indeed
organic chemistry enables a molecular understanding of physicochemical
phenomena in materials science, the environment, biology, and medicine.
Because the field has reached a high level of integration with these
areas, progress in organic chemistry continues at a fast pace and much
more remains to be discovered.

The goal of this course is to drive the student to appreciate the
breadth of organic chemistry by facilitating an understanding of the
principles, and the practice of applying them, to gain a working
knowledge and appreciation of organic structure and reactivity. The
second semester in the sequence also emphesizes that our only way to
molecular knowledge is through experimentation; correlating structure
with reactivity and function through wet chemical methods, spectroscopy,
and use of computational simulations.

# Course learning objectives

It is expected that you come to this course already familiar with
concepts and skills introduced in CHEM 128A and you are able to:

-   communicate the structure and reactivity of organic molecules using
    drawing and naming conventions;
-   analyze bonding and its consequences on molecular structure and
    reactivity of organic molecules; and
-   analyze the interplay between electronic, steric, and orbital
    interactions to predict the reactivity and properties of organic
    molecules and reactive intermediates (carbocations, radicals,
    anions, etc.).

Concepts and skills listed above will be further developed and
reinforced in CHEM 128B. Upon successful completion of CHEM 128B
students will be able to:

-   predict products, infer substrates, and propose reagents needed to
    complete a chemical reactions;
-   use spectroscopic data to deduce the structure of the molecule.
-   use retrosynthetic analysis to plan multi-step synthesis of target
    molecules; and
-   use curved arrow notation to depict organic reaction mechanisms
    including addition, elimination, substitution, rearrangement,
    functional group interconversions and redox transformations.

## Course materials and technology

This course is part of the Immediate Access program. All students have
access to a digital version of the textbook and associated materials on
the first day of class. Students who wish to purchase course materials
on their own can opt-out before their account is automatically charged
on the 10th day (5th day for Summer courses) of instruction. Contact the
Kennel Bookstore for more details.

-   **Textbook:** "Organic Chemistry" online textbook with integrated
    Study Guide and Solutions Manual by David Klein 4th edition
    published by Wiley (via Immediate Access). It is okay to use prior
    editions of the textbook but you may not have the access to the
    WileyPLUS platform (see below).
-   **WileyPLUS:** Online learning platform and homework. WileyPLUS is
    integrated with Canvas and all links to assignments and materials
    will be posted on Canvas. [^1]
-   **A personal computer**: running Windows or macOS, that can run
    desktop applications and has a reliable access to high-speed
    internet. A tablet device is an acceptable alternative, but the
    online homework platform is not optimized for mobile devices.
-   **A modern web browser**: Chrome is the recommended browser by
    Fresno State IT. Other browsers such as Edge, Firefox, or Safari are
    likely to work just as well but the support will be limited.
-   **Canvas:** The central repository for all course materials and
    information found here:\
    <https://fresnostate.instructure.com>.
-   **Zoom:** Virtual class meetings will be held via Zoom. Links and
    passwords to zoom meetings will be published on Canvas. Make sure
    your Zoom client is up to date.
-   **Document scanning tool**: Many assignments in this course are
    designed to be prepared by hand on paper. Few people own document
    scanners nowadays, but a mobile device with a scanning app can do a
    sufficient job at converting paper documents into PDFs. There are
    number of options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that
    you like and learn how to use it.
-   **Active Fresno State network account** so that you can access
    email, Canvas, and Google Suite. If you have any issue with
    accessing any of the above, please let me know as soon as possible.
    We will use a variety of additional course tools during the
    semester, but they will be free to use, and you will be taught how
    to use them as part of the class.

# Structure of the course

I designed this course according to the flipped learning model, an
instructional philosophy optimized for active learning. Direct
instruction is done before class meetings through structured activities
and class time is repurposed for collaborative work on creative
applications. This [video series](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8484250)
highlights the basics of flipped learning.

**Before class**, your task will be to review previously covered
material, and get familiar with the basic concepts of the upcoming
lesson. Not all new material needs formal instruction. Information is
abundant and you can learn the basics on your own (with guidance from
the instructor). I will provide a list of suggested reading and video
content for you to review before the lesson. Most times the pre-class
activities will include a discussion on Perusall.

**Class time** will be structured around agile lesson plans that aim to
operate within middle third of [Bloom
taxonomy](https://flic.kr/p/LQuqT2). There may be some small lectures or
tutorials, but active work will be the main component since the best way
to learn organic chemistry is by doing lots of problems. We will have
Zoom conference calls on the days/times the class is scheduled. The
sessions will be recorded, but it is in your best interest to attend
live class meetings.

**After class** you must continue to engage with the material through
deliberate practice and deliberation on the ideas discussed in class
until you're ready to show mastery by attempting Learning Target
problems on Checkpoints.

## Learning activities and assessments

You will be engaging with several kinds of activities in the course,
both to facilitate learning of the material and to demonstrate how well
you have learned it. The course uses a *mastery-based grading system* in
which your work will be required to meet certain levels of quality that
demonstrate *mastery*. These include:

1.  **Learning Targets** are main skills and tasks you should be able to
    do if you're successfully learning in CHEM 128B. There are 15
    Learning Targets in the course (see [Appendix B](#appendix-a)), 6 of
    which are designated as **CORE** targets due to their central nature
    in Organic Chemistry. Your primary goal is to provide evidence of
    mastery on as many targets as possible. You will do that through
    *Checkpoints* which are asynchronous at-home exams. See ["How work
    is graded in CHEM 128B"](#grading) below for details.
2.  **Perusall** is a tool for collective and collaborative reading and
    annotating. We will use Perusall to read and discuss class material.
    Hopefully you're reading this syllabus on Perusall right now and
    getting the idea of how it works.
3.  **Mechanism Portfolio** is a collection of reaction mechanisms that
    you draw as you learn material in this course. Writing reaction
    mechanisms by using curved arrow notation will help you better
    understand reaction pathways.
4.  **Application/Extension Problems (AEP)** are more challenging
    integrated problems for which students must clearly communicate a
    complete solution. AEPs assesses student skills across multiple
    learning objectives, may require technology, and all will require a
    formal writeup. Submission and grading of AEPs is discussed in ["How
    work is graded in CHEM 128B"](#grading) section below.
5.  **Final exam** will be on **Monday, July 19th, 2021 at 9:00 am**.
    The final exam is composed of 70 multiple choice questions designed
    by experts from the American Chemical Society. The final exam will
    be administered online via Canvas and the Respondus Lockdown
    Browser.

# How work is graded in CHEM 128B {#grading}

CHEM 128B uses a mastery-based grading system that is designed to
provide you with control over the grading process. The final grade in
CHEM 128B will be determined by the quantity and quality of evidence you
provide that show you have mastered the course learning objectives.

## Checkpoints and scoring of graded work

One of your primary responsibilities in the course is to demonstrate as
much skill as possible on as many Learning Targets as possible through
doing "acceptable" work on *Checkpoints*. Checkpoint is a window of time
during which a packet of problems (containing one problem per learning
target) will be available on Canvas You will have 3 hours, from the
moment you download the document, to submit your work. *You will only
need to attempt problems for Learning Targets that you have not yet
mastered*.

Your skill on Learning Targets is indicated in the gradebook by a
**rating**. There are three ratings available:

-   **No Rating**. A blank entry or zero will appear in the gradebook if
    you have not yet attempted a Learning Target through a Checkpoint.
    Everyone begins the semester with "No Rating" on all 15 Learning
    Targets.
-   **Proficiency.** Once you complete **one** Checkpoint problem on a
    Learning Target that meets the standards for acceptable work, you
    will "level up" to *Proficiency*.
-   **Mastery.** Once you complete **a second** Checkpoint problem on a
    Learning Target that meets the standards for acceptable work, you
    will "level up" to *Mastery*.

**Every Checkpoint is cumulative**, with new Learning Targets
represented but also new versions of older ones. This will allow you to
reattempt, on a limited basis, any Learning Target you do not "level up"
on. Work that meets the criteria will be given a *satisfactory* score.
Work that does not meet the criteria can be attempted again at later
checkpoint (see the [Revision](revisions) policy for details.

## Scoring of AEPs and the EMPX rubric

Work on Application/Extension Problems (AEPs) is scored not with points
but with one of four designation: "E" (Excellent/Exemplary), "M" (Meets
Expetations), "P" (Progressing), or "X" (Not Assessable). Whenever your
work on an AEP is graded, you will be given extensive actionable
feedback on what was done well and what needs improvement. The process
of assigning these marks is shown on the rubric diagram below:

![EMPX rubric](./empx-rubric-v2021.png)

## Revisions and reassessment {#revisions}

You can reattempt Learning Target problems which you did not master yet
at a later *Checkpoint*. AEPs earning M, P, or X can be revised and
resubmitted at any time. They will be regraded using the same standards
as originally used. Only one AEP submission can may be made per week.
This can be one new submission, or one revision. A second submission can
be purchased with a [token](#tokens) (below) but three or more
submissions in a week are not allowed under any circumstance. Students
have to spend a token in order to revise any AEP that was scored as "X"
(Not Assessable).

## Tokens

Tokens are a fake currency that are used to "purchase" exceptions to
course policies and other advantageous items in the course. Every
student starts with five tokens which can be spent for any of the
following at any time:

-   submit a second AEP (either revision or new submission) in a given
    week;
-   revise an AEP scored as "X"; and
-   extend the checkpoint deadline by 1 hour.

Tokens may not be "stacked". For example, by spending 3 tokens to get a
3-hour *Checkpoint* deadline extension.

## Final letter grade

Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to earn
a particular letter grade, each requirement must be met in the column
for that grade, **the highest grade for which all the requirements are
met**. There are no statistical or numerical adjustments (a.k.a. grading
on a curve). Failing grade (F) is given if not all the requirements for
a "D" are met.

The mastery-based grading system insists that you show consistent
excellence in all assignments in the course. That is, an outstanding
work on AEPs, for example, does not "bring up" poor work on LTs. In the
table below, numerical values indicate the minimum level needed to meet
the requirement; amounts above this level also meet the requirement. For
AEP's, "M+" means "either M or E".

  Category              D    C    B     A
  --------------------- ---- ---- ----- ---------
  LTs Mastered          7    9    11    13
  All CORE Mastered     No   No   Yes   Yes
  AEP                             1M+   1E, 1M+
  Mechanism Portfolio   14   20   26    32
  Perusall points       6    9    12    15

```{=html}
<!-- | Final Exam (ACS)    | 21 | 28 | 35  | 42      | -->
```
Read the example on the next page and referring back to the table above
try to determine the final letter grade.

```{=tex}
\clearpage
```
### Example

At the end of the semester Alex earned 44 points on the final exam, and
24 points on Perusall. Alex has 30 mechanisms in the Porfrolio as well
as three AEPs (one graded "E", two graded "M"). Alex showed *Mastery* on
12 Learning Targets including all CORE targets.[^2]

# Course policies

## Technology issues when submitting work

It is the student's responsibility to make sure these items are
submitted on time, even if technology issues arise. Technology issues
that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be
considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you
are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won't accept the file,
you should try again later, use different browser, upload to Google
Drive and share a private link or send the file as an email attachment
until you can upload it successfully.

## Academic integrity

Academic dishonesty carries with it strong punitive measures mandated by
Fresno State policies, including possible automatic failure of the
course or suspension from the university. Details are described in
Academic Policy Manual 235 which you can read here:
<http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf>. **Every student
has the responsibility of reading and understanding these policies,
especially the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest
activities.**

Some of the work you will do in the course involves collaboration; at
other times collaboration may be allowed but not required; while at
others it may not be allowed. Here are the rules for collaboration on
each kind of work you do:

-   *Mechanism Portfolio*: You may collaborate with others, but your
    writeup must be your own. You may not copy someone's work and submit
    it as your own, nor may you copy the ideas from someone and simply
    change how it's presented (or change wording).
-   *Checkpoints*, *AEPs*, and *ACS exam*: No interactions at all with
    another person or with unauthorized sources on the internet is
    allowed. Any evidence of using information from another person or
    source will be investigated as academic dishonesty.

### Resources you can and cannot use when submitting graded work

Here are the approved resources you can access on all *Checkpoints*:

-   the textbook;
-   video or document posted on Canvas site for this courses (but not
    other courses);
-   Perusall discussions and annotations;
-   slides, class meeting notes, and other materials generated during
    class time; and
-   class zoom recordings.

**Any resource NOT included on this list is to be considered off-limits
and not approved for use on Checkpoints. Evidence of using unapproved
resources will be considered academic dishonesty.** This includes:

-   solution websites such as Chegg;
-   other students in the class, or past students from other CHEM 128
    classes; and
-   other textbooks or videos not included above.

All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be thoroughly
investigated, and whether a student has committed academic dishonesty is
my determination to make based on the evidence. If I determine academic
dishonesty has been committed, a report will be filed with the Dean of
Students office, and the minimum penalty will be:

-   "no pass" grade on a checkpoint and no possibility for retake;
-   grade of "N" on AEP assignment and no possibility for revision; and
-   point deduction on final ACS exam.

## Deadlines and late work

Deadlines for course work are clearly indicated on the Course Calendar;
in cases of apparent conflict between dates, always assume that the
Course Calendar is right.

-   *Mechanism Portfolio and Perusall Activities*: No extensions to
    deadlines are available. Simply submit a good faith effort on all
    items by the deadline.
-   *Checkpoints*: Submission window may be extended by spending a
    token. No other extensions are available.
-   *AEPs*: There is only one deadline for AEP's: **Monday, July 19th,
    2021 at 5 pm** Otherwise you simply submit your work when it is
    ready to be graded (subject to weekly limits). This deadline will
    not be extended.

## Intellectual Property

As part of your participation in virtual/online instruction, please
remember that the same student conduct rules that are used for in-person
classrooms instruction also apply for virtual/online classrooms.
Students are prohibited from any unauthorized recording, dissemination,
or publication of any academic presentation, including any online
classroom instruction, for any commercial purpose. In addition, students
may not record or use virtual/online instruction in any manner that
would violate copyright law. Students are to use all online/virtual
instruction exclusively for the educational purpose of the online class
in which the instruction is being provided. Students may not re-record
any online recordings or post any online recordings on any other format
(e.g., electronic, video, social media, audio recording, web page,
internet, hard paper copy, etc.) for any purpose without the explicit
written permission of the faculty member providing the instruction.
Exceptions for disability-related accommodations will be addressed by
Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) working in conjunction
with the student and faculty member.

## Dropping the course

Dates and details on withdrawing from courses are described on the
[Admissions web
pages](http://fresnostate.edu/studentaffairs/are/registration/add-drop-deadlines.html).

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition
that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly
arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings
and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to
and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The
condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student
must provide documentation that substantiates the condition. Failing or
performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious and
compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction
with the subject matter, class or instructor.

## Changes to this syllabus

Changes to this syllabus may occur during the term. In those cases, the
changes will be announced in class and online, and if appropriate,
students will be given a voice on how the changes will be implemented.
It is your responsibility stay abreast of the information passed along
in course announcements so that you will be aware of any changes that
take place.

## Credits

Portions of the language of this syllabus as well as ideas related to
mastery grading were adapted from the syllabi of [Prof. Robert
Talbert](https://hackmd.io/@rtalbert235) (Grand Valley University).
