The goals of this module is to expand our knowledge of compounds with alcohol functional group. Learning targets associated with this module are:

  * E1: Analyze electronic structure of molecules to make and defend predictions about alcohols, phenols, and thiols in light of the Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory; 
  * R1: (**CORE**) Predict products, infer substrates, and propose reagents needed to complete a reaction scheme involving alcohols; and
  * M1: Use curved arrow notation to depict plausible reaction mechanisms that involve alcohols.

### Review

As you read chapter 12 you will notice that chemistry of alcohols was discussed before and there are a lot of cross-references to prior chapters: 

  * acid-base chemistry of alcohols (chapter 3); 
  * physical properties of alcohols; 
  * preparation of alcohols by substitution (chapter 7) and addition (chapter 8); and
  * reactions of alcohols in substitution and elimination reactions (chapter 7).

Although these topics are included in the learning objectives, we will not spend significant amount of time on them. 

### Part 1

  * Pre-class: Read chapter 12 and re-read sections 3.03-3.07 in chapter 3. 
  * In-class: Alcohols as Brønsted-Lowry acids
  * Post-class: Practice problems suggested in SkillBuilder 12.2. Add scans of your work in Module Portfolio

### Part 2

  * Pre-class: Complete the WileyPLUS assignments called "Do You Remember" from Chapter 12
  * In-class: Alcohols as products of addition to carbonyl (hydride reduction and Grignard reaction)
  * Post-class: Practice problems suggested in SkillBuilder 12.3, 12.4, and 12.5. Add scans of your work in Module Portfolio

### Part 3

  * Pre-class: Complete the WileyPLUS assignments called "Conceptual Checkpoints" from Chapter 12. Review the inductive effect on acidity.
  * In-class: Alcohols as reactants in oxidation reactions
  * Post-class: Practice problems suggested in SkillBuilder 12.7 and draw the mechanism of Swern oxidation. Add scans of your work in Module Portfolio.
