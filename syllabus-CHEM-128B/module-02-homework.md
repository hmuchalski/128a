--Marcus Aurelius, _Meditations_, 1.7.3

We finished discussing the chemistry of alcohols and phenols. However, we only scratched the surface. It is now on you to develop a deep understanding and clarity of principles that govern chemistry of organic molecules with an OH group. You can do that by completing the WileyPLUS assignments for Chapter 12 (login to WileyPLUS to see the full list).
