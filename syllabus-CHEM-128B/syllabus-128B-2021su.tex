\section{Start here}\label{start-here}}

Welcome to the second semester of organic chemistry course (CHEM 128B)!
I'm Hubert Muchalski, a professor in Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry. Before reading any further, here are some things to know:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{I want you to be successful in this course.} I will do my
  utmost to help you do this, by creating and maintaining a learning
  environment based on challenge and support. ``Success'' in the course
  is more than just good grades. It means that you are being challenged
  to grow as a learner, that you are engaging actively with tasks that
  feed your growth, and that you are doing your best work by solving
  challenging organic chemistry problems. It also means that you are
  building your lifelong learning skills so that once the course is
  over, you are better and stronger as a learner and can continue to
  learn new things independently.
\item
  \textbf{College-level chemistry is more than just memorizing
  structures and reactions}. On the pathway to success as outlined
  above, you will be asked to do more than just give answers to
  problems. Your task is to seek deep understanding of underlying
  concepts and working on explaining of the outcomes of chemical
  reactions and properties of organic molecules.
\item
  \textbf{Expect to be challenged intellectually throughout this
  course.} None of these elements of success come easily. They require a
  great deal of time and attention to properly deal with ambiguity of
  the concepts and tasks in the course. This will require you to leave
  your comfort zones on a regular basis. You will need to stay engaged
  by participating in class meetings and on the class discussion
  board---asking questions, seeking understanding, and giving help.
\item
  \textbf{Intellectual struggle is normal and healthy in a challenging
  course.} You can expect at times to feel like you are really
  struggling with the material, even if learning in earlier chemistry
  courses came easy. This is a normal and healthy experience. Legitimate
  struggle is actually a sign you are doing things right, training your
  mind beyond what it is capable at the moment. My goal is to support
  you in this process.
\item
  \textbf{You have a lot of help available to you as you work.}
  Throughout the semester, you will be given a lot of support to help
  you rise to the challenge. I will do my best to be available for
  consultations. You're not alone in this so please engage with your
  classmates, ask questions, seek clarification but also be provide help
  whenever you can.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Carbon-based molecules are central to a host of chemical and biological
processes because of their broad range of structure and reactivity. The
millions of organic compounds alone, ranging from polymers to
pharmaceuticals, make the field important for study. Yet organic
chemistry is also a highly integrated discipline that impacts and is
impacted by the other branches of chemistry and other sciences. Indeed
organic chemistry enables a molecular understanding of physicochemical
phenomena in materials science, the environment, biology, and medicine.
Because the field has reached a high level of integration with these
areas, progress in organic chemistry continues at a fast pace and much
more remains to be discovered.

The goal of this course is to drive the student to appreciate the
breadth of organic chemistry by facilitating an understanding of the
principles, and the practice of applying them, to gain a working
knowledge and appreciation of organic structure and reactivity. The
second semester in the sequence also emphesizes that our only way to
molecular knowledge is through experimentation; correlating structure
with reactivity and function through wet chemical methods, spectroscopy,
and use of computational simulations.

\hypertarget{course-learning-objectives}{%
\section{Course learning objectives}\label{course-learning-objectives}}

It is expected that you come to this course already familiar with
concepts and skills introduced in CHEM 128A and you are able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  communicate the structure and reactivity of organic molecules using
  drawing and naming conventions;
\item
  analyze bonding and its consequences on molecular structure and
  reactivity of organic molecules; and
\item
  analyze the interplay between electronic, steric, and orbital
  interactions to predict the reactivity and properties of organic
  molecules and reactive intermediates (carbocations, radicals, anions,
  etc.).
\end{itemize}

Concepts and skills listed above will be further developed and
reinforced in CHEM 128B. Upon successful completion of CHEM 128B
students will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  predict products, infer substrates, and propose reagents needed to
  complete a chemical reactions;
\item
  use spectroscopic data to deduce the structure of the molecule.
\item
  use retrosynthetic analysis to plan multi-step synthesis of target
  molecules; and
\item
  use curved arrow notation to depict organic reaction mechanisms
  including addition, elimination, substitution, rearrangement,
  functional group interconversions and redox transformations.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{course-materials-and-technology}{%
\subsection{Course materials and
technology}\label{course-materials-and-technology}}

This course is part of the Immediate Access program. All students have
access to a digital version of the textbook and associated materials on
the first day of class. Students who wish to purchase course materials
on their own can opt-out before their account is automatically charged
on the 10th day (5th day for Summer courses) of instruction. Contact the
Kennel Bookstore for more details.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Textbook:} ``Organic Chemistry'' online textbook with
  integrated Study Guide and Solutions Manual by David Klein 4th edition
  published by Wiley (via Immediate Access). It is okay to use prior
  editions of the textbook but you may not have the access to the
  WileyPLUS platform (see below).
\item
  \textbf{WileyPLUS:} Online learning platform and homework. WileyPLUS
  is integrated with Canvas and all links to assignments and materials
  will be posted on Canvas. \footnote{WileyPLUS version must be the same
    as the official edition of the textbook (4th ed.). If you opt out of
    Immediate Access and buy the textbook and access to WileyPLUS
    through other means, make sure that your access code is for the 4th
    edition of the textbook.}
\item
  \textbf{A personal computer}: running Windows or macOS, that can run
  desktop applications and has a reliable access to high-speed internet.
  A tablet device is an acceptable alternative, but the online homework
  platform is not optimized for mobile devices.
\item
  \textbf{A modern web browser}: Chrome is the recommended browser by
  Fresno State IT. Other browsers such as Edge, Firefox, or Safari are
  likely to work just as well but the support will be limited.
\item
  \textbf{Canvas:} The central repository for all course materials and
  information found here:\\
  \url{https://fresnostate.instructure.com}.
\item
  \textbf{Zoom:} Virtual class meetings will be held via Zoom. Links and
  passwords to zoom meetings will be published on Canvas. Make sure your
  Zoom client is up to date.
\item
  \textbf{Document scanning tool}: Many assignments in this course are
  designed to be prepared by hand on paper. Few people own document
  scanners nowadays, but a mobile device with a scanning app can do a
  sufficient job at converting paper documents into PDFs. There are
  number of options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that
  you like and learn how to use it.
\item
  \textbf{Active Fresno State network account} so that you can access
  email, Canvas, and Google Suite. If you have any issue with accessing
  any of the above, please let me know as soon as possible. We will use
  a variety of additional course tools during the semester, but they
  will be free to use, and you will be taught how to use them as part of
  the class.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{structure-of-the-course}{%
\section{Structure of the course}\label{structure-of-the-course}}

I designed this course according to the flipped learning model, an
instructional philosophy optimized for active learning. Direct
instruction is done before class meetings through structured activities
and class time is repurposed for collaborative work on creative
applications. This \href{https://vimeo.com/showcase/8484250}{video
series} highlights the basics of flipped learning.

\textbf{Before class}, your task will be to review previously covered
material, and get familiar with the basic concepts of the upcoming
lesson. Not all new material needs formal instruction. Information is
abundant and you can learn the basics on your own (with guidance from
the instructor). I will provide a list of suggested reading and video
content for you to review before the lesson. Most times the pre-class
activities will include a discussion on Perusall.

\textbf{Class time} will be structured around agile lesson plans that
aim to operate within middle third of
\href{https://flic.kr/p/LQuqT2}{Bloom taxonomy}. There may be some small
lectures or tutorials, but active work will be the main component since
the best way to learn organic chemistry is by doing lots of problems. We
will have Zoom conference calls on the days/times the class is
scheduled. The sessions will be recorded, but it is in your best
interest to attend live class meetings.

\textbf{After class} you must continue to engage with the material
through deliberate practice and deliberation on the ideas discussed in
class until you're ready to show mastery by attempting Learning Target
problems on Checkpoints.

\hypertarget{learning-activities-and-assessments}{%
\subsection{Learning activities and
assessments}\label{learning-activities-and-assessments}}

You will be engaging with several kinds of activities in the course,
both to facilitate learning of the material and to demonstrate how well
you have learned it. The course uses a \emph{mastery-based grading
system} in which your work will be required to meet certain levels of
quality that demonstrate \emph{mastery}. These include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Learning Targets} are main skills and tasks you should be able
  to do if you're successfully learning in CHEM 128B. There are 15
  Learning Targets in the course (see
  \protect\hyperlink{appendix-a}{Appendix B}), 6 of which are designated
  as \textbf{CORE} targets due to their central nature in Organic
  Chemistry. Your primary goal is to provide evidence of mastery on as
  many targets as possible. You will do that through \emph{Checkpoints}
  which are asynchronous at-home exams. See
  \protect\hyperlink{grading}{``How work is graded in CHEM 128B''} below
  for details.
\item
  \textbf{Perusall} is a tool for collective and collaborative reading
  and annotating. We will use Perusall to read and discuss class
  material. Hopefully you're reading this syllabus on Perusall right now
  and getting the idea of how it works.
\item
  \textbf{Mechanism Portfolio} is a collection of reaction mechanisms
  that you draw as you learn material in this course. Writing reaction
  mechanisms by using curved arrow notation will help you better
  understand reaction pathways.
\item
  \textbf{Application/Extension Problems (AEP)} are more challenging
  integrated problems for which students must clearly communicate a
  complete solution. AEPs assesses student skills across multiple
  learning objectives, may require technology, and all will require a
  formal writeup. Submission and grading of AEPs is discussed in
  \protect\hyperlink{grading}{``How work is graded in CHEM 128B''}
  section below.
\item
  \textbf{Final exam} will be on \textbf{Monday, July 19th, 2021 at 9:00
  am}. The final exam is composed of 70 multiple choice questions
  designed by experts from the American Chemical Society. The final exam
  will be administered online via Canvas and the Respondus Lockdown
  Browser.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{grading}{%
\section{How work is graded in CHEM 128B}\label{grading}}

CHEM 128B uses a mastery-based grading system that is designed to
provide you with control over the grading process. The final grade in
CHEM 128B will be determined by the quantity and quality of evidence you
provide that show you have mastered the course learning objectives.

\hypertarget{checkpoints-and-scoring-of-graded-work}{%
\subsection{Checkpoints and scoring of graded
work}\label{checkpoints-and-scoring-of-graded-work}}

One of your primary responsibilities in the course is to demonstrate as
much skill as possible on as many Learning Targets as possible through
doing ``acceptable'' work on \emph{Checkpoints}. Checkpoint is a window
of time during which a packet of problems (containing one problem per
learning target) will be available on Canvas You will have 3 hours, from
the moment you download the document, to submit your work. \emph{You
will only need to attempt problems for Learning Targets that you have
not yet mastered}.

Your skill on Learning Targets is indicated in the gradebook by a
\textbf{rating}. There are three ratings available:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{No Rating}. A blank entry or zero will appear in the gradebook
  if you have not yet attempted a Learning Target through a Checkpoint.
  Everyone begins the semester with ``No Rating'' on all 15 Learning
  Targets.
\item
  \textbf{Proficiency.} Once you complete \textbf{one} Checkpoint
  problem on a Learning Target that meets the standards for acceptable
  work, you will ``level up'' to \emph{Proficiency}.
\item
  \textbf{Mastery.} Once you complete \textbf{a second} Checkpoint
  problem on a Learning Target that meets the standards for acceptable
  work, you will ``level up'' to \emph{Mastery}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Every Checkpoint is cumulative}, with new Learning Targets
represented but also new versions of older ones. This will allow you to
reattempt, on a limited basis, any Learning Target you do not ``level
up'' on. Work that meets the criteria will be given a
\emph{satisfactory} score. Work that does not meet the criteria can be
attempted again at later checkpoint (see the \href{revisions}{Revision}
policy for details.

\hypertarget{scoring-of-aeps-and-the-empx-rubric}{%
\subsection{Scoring of AEPs and the EMPX
rubric}\label{scoring-of-aeps-and-the-empx-rubric}}

Work on Application/Extension Problems (AEPs) is scored not with points
but with one of four designation: ``E'' (Excellent/Exemplary), ``M''
(Meets Expetations), ``P'' (Progressing), or ``X'' (Not Assessable).
Whenever your work on an AEP is graded, you will be given extensive
actionable feedback on what was done well and what needs improvement.
The process of assigning these marks is shown on the rubric diagram
below:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./empx-rubric-v2021.png}
\caption{EMPX rubric}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{revisions}{%
\subsection{Revisions and reassessment}\label{revisions}}

You can reattempt Learning Target problems which you did not master yet
at a later \emph{Checkpoint}. AEPs earning M, P, or X can be revised and
resubmitted at any time. They will be regraded using the same standards
as originally used. Only one AEP submission can may be made per week.
This can be one new submission, or one revision. A second submission can
be purchased with a \protect\hyperlink{tokens}{token} (below) but three
or more submissions in a week are not allowed under any circumstance.
Students have to spend a token in order to revise any AEP that was
scored as ``X'' (Not Assessable).

\hypertarget{tokens}{%
\subsection{Tokens}\label{tokens}}

Tokens are a fake currency that are used to ``purchase'' exceptions to
course policies and other advantageous items in the course. Every
student starts with five tokens which can be spent for any of the
following at any time:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  submit a second AEP (either revision or new submission) in a given
  week;
\item
  revise an AEP scored as ``X''; and
\item
  extend the checkpoint deadline by 1 hour.
\end{itemize}

Tokens may not be ``stacked''. For example, by spending 3 tokens to get
a 3-hour \emph{Checkpoint} deadline extension.

\hypertarget{final-letter-grade}{%
\subsection{Final letter grade}\label{final-letter-grade}}

Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to earn
a particular letter grade, each requirement must be met in the column
for that grade, \textbf{the highest grade for which all the requirements
are met}. There are no statistical or numerical adjustments (a.k.a.
grading on a curve). Failing grade (F) is given if not all the
requirements for a ``D'' are met.

The mastery-based grading system insists that you show consistent
excellence in all assignments in the course. That is, an outstanding
work on AEPs, for example, does not ``bring up'' poor work on LTs. In
the table below, numerical values indicate the minimum level needed to
meet the requirement; amounts above this level also meet the
requirement. For AEP's, ``M+'' means ``either M or E''.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
Category & D & C & B & A \\
\midrule
\endhead
LTs Mastered & 7 & 9 & 11 & 13 \\
All CORE Mastered & No & No & Yes & Yes \\
AEP & & & 1M+ & 1E, 1M+ \\
Mechanism Portfolio & 14 & 20 & 26 & 32 \\
Perusall points & 6 & 9 & 12 & 15 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Read the example on the next page and referring back to the table above
try to determine the final letter grade.

\hypertarget{example}{%
\subsubsection{Example}\label{example}}

At the end of the semester Alex earned 44 points on the final exam, and
24 points on Perusall. Alex has 30 mechanisms in the Porfrolio as well
as three AEPs (one graded ``E'', two graded ``M''). Alex showed
\emph{Mastery} on 12 Learning Targets including all CORE
targets.\footnote{The final grade in the course for Alex will be ``B'',
  because Alex did not meet all requirements for A (minimum 13 LTs
  mastered).}

\hypertarget{technology-issues-when-submitting-work}{%
\subsection{Technology issues when submitting
work}\label{technology-issues-when-submitting-work}}

It is the student's responsibility to make sure these items are
submitted on time, even if technology issues arise. Technology issues
that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be
considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you
are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won't accept the file,
you should try again later, use different browser, upload to Google
Drive and share a private link or send the file as an email attachment
until you can upload it successfully.

\hypertarget{academic-integrity}{%
\subsection{Academic integrity}\label{academic-integrity}}

Academic dishonesty carries with it strong punitive measures mandated by
Fresno State policies, including possible automatic failure of the
course or suspension from the university. Details are described in
Academic Policy Manual 235 which you can read here:
\url{http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf}.
\textbf{Every student has the responsibility of reading and
understanding these policies, especially the consequences for engaging
in academically dishonest activities.}

Some of the work you will do in the course involves collaboration; at
other times collaboration may be allowed but not required; while at
others it may not be allowed. Here are the rules for collaboration on
each kind of work you do:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Mechanism Portfolio}: You may collaborate with others, but your
  writeup must be your own. You may not copy someone's work and submit
  it as your own, nor may you copy the ideas from someone and simply
  change how it's presented (or change wording).
\item
  \emph{Checkpoints}, \emph{AEPs}, and \emph{ACS exam}: No interactions
  at all with another person or with unauthorized sources on the
  internet is allowed. Any evidence of using information from another
  person or source will be investigated as academic dishonesty.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{resources-you-can-and-cannot-use-when-submitting-graded-work}{%
\subsubsection{Resources you can and cannot use when submitting graded
work}\label{resources-you-can-and-cannot-use-when-submitting-graded-work}}

Here are the approved resources you can access on all
\emph{Checkpoints}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the textbook;
\item
  video or document posted on Canvas site for this courses (but not
  other courses);
\item
  Perusall discussions and annotations;
\item
  slides, class meeting notes, and other materials generated during
  class time; and
\item
  class zoom recordings.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Any resource NOT included on this list is to be considered
off-limits and not approved for use on Checkpoints. Evidence of using
unapproved resources will be considered academic dishonesty.} This
includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  solution websites such as Chegg;
\item
  other students in the class, or past students from other CHEM 128
  classes; and
\item
  other textbooks or videos not included above.
\end{itemize}

All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be thoroughly
investigated, and whether a student has committed academic dishonesty is
my determination to make based on the evidence. If I determine academic
dishonesty has been committed, a report will be filed with the Dean of
Students office, and the minimum penalty will be:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``no pass'' grade on a checkpoint and no possibility for retake;
\item
  grade of ``N'' on AEP assignment and no possibility for revision; and
\item
  point deduction on final ACS exam.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{deadlines-and-late-work}{%
\subsection{Deadlines and late work}\label{deadlines-and-late-work}}

Deadlines for course work are clearly indicated on the Course Calendar;
in cases of apparent conflict between dates, always assume that the
Course Calendar is right.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Mechanism Portfolio and Perusall Activities}: No extensions to
  deadlines are available. Simply submit a good faith effort on all
  items by the deadline.
\item
  \emph{Checkpoints}: Submission window may be extended by spending a
  token. No other extensions are available.
\item
  \emph{AEPs}: There is only one deadline for AEP's: \textbf{Monday,
  July 19th, 2021 at 5 pm} Otherwise you simply submit your work when it
  is ready to be graded (subject to weekly limits). This deadline will
  not be extended.

As part of your participation in virtual/online instruction, please
remember that the same student conduct rules that are used for in-person
classrooms instruction also apply for virtual/online classrooms.
Students are prohibited from any unauthorized recording, dissemination,

A \emph{serious and compelling reason} is defined as an unexpected
condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that
unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend
class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be
acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the
department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the
appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that
substantiates the condition. Failing or performing poorly in a class is
not an acceptable ``serious and compelling reason'' within the
University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class
or instructor.
