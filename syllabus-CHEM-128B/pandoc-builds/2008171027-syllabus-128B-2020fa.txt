==========

Welcome to the second semester of course in organic chemistry (CHEM
128B)! I'm Hubert Muchalski, a professor in the Chemistry Department.
Before reading any further, here are some things to know:

1.  **I want you to be successful in this course.** I will do my utmost
    to help you do this, by creating and maintaining a learning
    environment based on challenge and support. "Success" in the course
    is more than just good grades. It means that you are being
    **challenged** to grow as a learner, that you are **engaging
    actively** with tasks that feed your growth, and that you are
    creating **excellent work** by solving challenging organic chemistry
    problems. It also means that you are **building your lifelong
    learning skills** so that once the course is over, you are better
    and stronger as a learner and can continue to learn new things
    independently.
2.  **College-level chemistry is more than just memorizing structures
    and reactions.** On the pathway to "success" as outlined above, you
    will be asked to do more than just give answers to problems. Your
    task is to **seek deep understanding** of underlying concepts and
    working on explaining of the outcomes of chemical reactions and
    properties of organic molecules.
3.  **Expect to be challenged intellectually throughout this course.**
    None of these elements of "success" come easily. They require
    dedicated devotion of time and energy to wrestling with the concepts
    and tasks in the course. This will require you to leave your comfort
    zones on a regular basis. You will need to stay engaged by
    participating in class meetings and on the class discussion
    board---asking questions, seeking understanding, and giving help.
4.  **Intellectual struggle is normal and healthy in a challenging
    course.** Since none of this is easy, you can expect at times to
    feel like you are really struggling with the material, even if in
    your earlier chemistry courses you might never have experienced
    struggle. **This is a normal and healthy experience.** Legitimate
    struggle is actually a sign you are doing things right, and it's a
    signal you're about to experience explosive growth. My goal is to
    provide **a safe place for you to experience those struggles.**
5.  **You have a lot of help available to you as you work.** Throughout
    the semester, you will be challenged but also given a lot of support
    to help you rise to the challenge. I will be readily available to
    help in several channels; your classmates will be available for help
    through structured and informal support groups. **Everyone in the
    course has your back.**

Learning objectives
-------------------

In this course we will continue to explore one of the richest and most
beautiful areas of modern chemistry: *chemistry of carbon-based
compounds*. This course is required for majors in life and physical
sciences because it covers topics and concepts that are essential for
understanding of biochemistry and medicine. Upon successful completion
of this course you will be able to:

-   Communicate the structure and properties using drawing and naming
    conventions introduced in CHEM 128A
-   Analyze electronic structure of molecules to make and defend
    predictions about their properties.
-   Predict products, infer substrates, and propose reagents needed to
    complete a chemical reactions.
-   Use curved arrow notation to depict plausible reaction mechanisms.
-   Use spectroscopic data to deduce the structure of the molecule.

**This course uses a different grading system** to ones that you
experienced in other courses and the details are explained in the
sections below. *Please read the entire syllabus carefully,* it is
nearly 4,000 words for a reason. Almost all questions about the course
that you might ask, can be answered by referencing the syllabus. If you
are uncertain that you understand all rules and regulations, please
contact me.

Course materials
----------------

This course is part of the Immediate Access program. All students have
access to a digital version of the textbook and associated materials on
the first day of class. Students who wish to purchase course materials
on their own, have *until the 10th day of instruction to opt-out*.
Students are automatically charged on the 10th day (5th day for Summer
courses) to continue to have access to course materials for the rest of
term. More info can be found at
<https://als.csuprojects.org/immediate_access_programs>

-   **Canvas:** The central repository for all course materials and
    information found here: <https://fresnostate.instructure.com>.
-   **Textbook:** "Organic Chemistry" online textbook with integrated
    Study Guide and Solutions Manual by David Klein 3rd edition
    published by Wiley (via Immediate Access).
-   **WileyPLUS with ORION:** Online learning platform and homework.
    WileyPLUS is integrated with Canvas and all links to assignments and
    materials will be posted on Canvas. [^1]
    `<!-- - **Classroom Response System:** We will use iClicker Reef mobile app to collect responses to questions posed during class. Physical remotes do not work in a virtual setting. -->`{=html}

Technology
----------

To use the course tools, you will need to have access to the following:

-   **A personal computer**: running Windows or macOS, that can run
    desktop applications and has a reliable access to high-speed
    internet. A tablet device is an acceptable alternative, but the
    online homework platform doesn't work as well on mobile devices.
-   **A modern web browser**: Chrome is recommended by campus IT, but
    browsers such as Edge, Firefox, or Safari are also fine.
-   **Zoom:** Virtual class meetings will be held via Zoom. Links and
    passwords to zoom meetings will be published on Canvas.
-   **Document scanning tool**: Many assignments in this course are
    designed to be prepared by hand on paper. Few people own document
    scanners nowadays, but a mobile device with a scanning app can do a
    sufficient job at converting paper documents into PDFs. There are
    number of options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that
    you like and learn how to use it.
-   **Active Fresno State network account** so that you can access
    email, Canvas, and Google Suite

If you have any issue with accessing any of the above, please let me
know as soon as possible. We will use a variety of additional course
tools during the semester, but they will be free to use, and you will be
taught how to use them as part of the class.

**Course content:** We will cover chapters 12-22 of the *Organic
Chemistry* text. Key topics to be studied include: understanding how
structure determines function and reactivity of organic molecules. In
every topic, we seek a **conceptual understanding** from several
perspectives, the ability to **apply ideas**, development of **logical
reasoning and communication skills**, and an **appreciation for organic
chemistry as a whole**.

Structure of the course
=======================

This CHEM 128B course is being offered in a virtual flipped mode.
"Flipped" means that the course is a combination of synchronous
(on-Zoom) and asynchronous (off-Zoom) work. The content is divided into
[12 modules](#modules), generally following the chapters in the
textbook. Your work in the class will follow a repeating pattern that
will involve you before, during, and after our Zoom meetings.

**Before each class,** your task will be to review previously covered
material, and get familiar with the basic concepts of the upcoming
lesson through guided reading, video, or exercises on new concepts. Not
all material needs formal instruction. Some sections are a review of
concepts from prior chapters, others present new content which not
difficult to learn on your own. Take notes and write down questions you
have while engaging in self-directed learning. You will have an
opportunity to ask them in class.

**Each class meeting,** which is only 50 minutes, we will begin with 10
min period for going over the pre-class material and fielding your
questions. Then we will spend most of the class (\~30 minutes) doing
activities together on the harder concepts from the material. There may
be some small lectures, but active work will be the main event since the
best way to learn organic chemistry is by doing lots of problems! The
remaining time (\~10 min) will be for reviewing the main points of the
lesson.

**After each class,** you will engage with the material through the
ongoing work: online homework to practice the ideas from the module
(WileyPLUS); Application/Extension problems that take your basic skills
to the next level: and Checkpoints given roughly every other week that
assess your mastery of basic skills.

Zoom meetings
-------------

We will have online conference calls on the days/times the class is
scheduled. The sessions will be recorded, although many activities will
happen in small breakout rooms and those aren't part of the recording.
It is in your interest to attend live class meetings.

Learning activities in CHEM 128B
================================

You will be engaging with several different kinds of activities in the
course, both to facilitate learning of the material and to demonstrate
how well you have learned it. Our course uses a *mastery-based grading
system* in which many graded items do not use points, but rather your
work will be required to meet certain levels of quality that demonstrate
*mastery*. We will discuss this several times in class, and there is
more information later in this document.

The kinds of activities you will undertake are:

1.  **Learning Target Assessments (LTA)** are short tests assessing
    student learning within one learning objective. Throughout the
    semester, you will be asked to provide evidence that you mastered
    the skills and concepts that by completing short quizzes, each
    addressing a single Learning Target. LTAs are graded either
    *satisfactory* or *progressing* and no partial credit is awarded.
    See ["How work is graded in CHEM 128B"](#grading) below for details.
2.  **Application/Extension Problems (AEP)** are more challenging
    integrated problems for which students must to clearly communicate a
    complete solution. AEPs assesses student skills across multiple
    learning objectives, may require technology, and all will require a
    formal writeup. AEPs are graded using the EMRN rubric discussed in
    ["How work is graded in CHEM 128B"](#grading) and can be revised and
    resubmitted if needed.
3.  **Preparation, practice, and participation (PPP)** category includes
    points earned on online pre-class assignments and online homework
    (WileyPLUS) as well as participation during lecture. It is in your
    interest to complete pre-class assignments because the results guide
    my decisions about what activities to plan and what concepts to
    focus on in the upcoming class meeting.
4.  **Module Portfolio (MP)** is a collection of notes and other content
    you generated while studying and practicing the topics discussed in
    each module.
5.  **Final exam** will be on **Monday, December 14th, 08:45--10:45
    AM**. Final exam is composed of 70 multiple choice questions
    designed by experts from the American Chemical Society. The final
    exam will be administered online via Canvas and the Respondus
    Lockdown Browser.

Mastery Checkpoints
-------------------

Roughly every 3 weeks, I will post *Mastery Checkpoint*, an exam packet
of LTAs, each one of which focuses on a single Learning Target from the
list in the [Appendix A](#appendix-a). Each **Checkpoint** will contain
one LTA that has been covered up to that point. For example, the first
**Checkpoint** may contain problems for Learning Targets E1, R1, R2, M1,
M2; the second **Checkpoint** will contain new versions of E1, R1, R2,
M1, M2 along with first-time problems for S1 through S3; and so on.
**You will only need to attempt problems for Learning Targets that you
have not yet mastered**. The cumulative structure allows you to attempt
problems multiple times in different weeks. Students will be provided
with a detailed rubric for what constitutes acceptable work on each LTA.
Work that meets the criteria will be given a *satisfactory* grade and
will be considered **mastered**. Work that does not meet the criteria
will receive an *progressing* grade and can be redone at any later
**Checkpoint** (see the [Revision](revisions) policy for details.

You can also show that you mastered the material through means other
than **Checkpoints**, but no more than 3 LTAs per semester, and no more
than one LTA per week, can be attempted through the following options:

-   **Option 1**: Schedule an oral assessment (via videoconference)
    during which I will give a new version of a **Checkpoint**-like LTA,
    and you solve that problem "live" at an acceptable level.
-   **Option 2**: Create a video of yourself working out the solution to
    a **Checkpoint**-like LTA that I will make for you, then submit the
    video. If you choose this option, you'll also be required to have a
    follow-up video meeting with me to discuss the solution and answer
    additional related questions to make sure you really understand the
    ideas. The video must adhere to standards for video creation (posted
    separately; basically the video must have clear audio, and keep
    face, handwriting, and voice in the frame at all times).

The EMRN rubric
---------------

Work on Application/Extension Problems is graded not with points but
with one of four designation: "E" (Excellent/Exemplary), "M" (Meets the
standard), "R" (Needs revision), or "N" (Not assessible/Not enough
information). Whenever your work on an AEP is graded, you will be given
extensive actionable feedback on what was done well and what needs
improvement. The process of assigning these marks is shown below:

![EMRN rubric](emrn.png)

How work is graded in CHEM 128B {#grading}
===============================

CHEM 128B uses a mastery-based grading system that is designed to
provide you with control over the grading process. The final grade in
CHEM 128B will be determined by the quantity and quality of evidence you
provide that show you have mastered the course learning objectives.
There are 24 Learning Targets in the course, 10 of which are designated
as **Core** targets due to their central nature in Organic Chemistry,
and the other 14 of which are designated as **Supplemental**. Students
get numerous opportunities to demonstrate mastery of the content
described in Learning Targets.

Final letter grade
------------------

Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to earn
a particular letter grade, each requirement must be met in the column
for that grade, **the highest grade for which all the requirements are
met**. There are no statistical or numerical adjustments (a.k.a. grading
on a curve). Failing grade (F) is given if not all the requirements for
a "D" are met.

Note: In the table, numerical values indicate the minimum level needed
to meet the requirement; amounts above this level also meet the
requirement. For AEP's, "M+" means "either M or E".

  Category                             D      C      B           A
  ------------------------------------ ------ ------ ----------- ----------
  Core Learning Targets (10)           5      10     10          10
  Supplemental Learning Targets (14)   5      6      9           12
  AEPs (8+)                            1 M+   2 M+   2 E, 4 M+   4E, 2 M+
  Module Portfolio (12)                4      6      8           10
  PPP (1000+)                          500    800    800         800
  Final Exam                           20%    30%    40%         50%

Revisions and tokens {#revisions}
--------------------

The mastery-based grading system insists that you show consistent
excellence in all assignments in the course. Outstanding work on
homework, for example, does not "bring up" poor work on LTAs. LTAs can
be revised by reattempting the item on a later *Checkpoint* or through
one of the other means described earlier.

AEPs earning M, R, or N can be revised and resubmitted at any time. They
will be regraded using the same standards as originally used. However,
there are two important limitations on your revision and resubmission of
AEP's:

1.  No more than two submissions of AEP sets may be made per week. This
    can be two new sets, two revisions, or one of each. A third
    submission can be purchased with a [token](#tokens) (below) but four
    or more submissions in a week are not allowed under any cirumstance.
2.  Revision of N grades rule: Students have to spend a token (below) in
    order to revise any AEP that was graded at "N" (Not Assessable).

Scores for WileyPLUS assignments are final. If you do not get a
percentage correct to show mastery (\>75%), you can reset the assignment
and try again until the deadline.

Tokens
------

Tokens are a fake currency that are used to "purchase" exceptions to
course policies and other advantageous items in the course. Every
student starts with five of these. One token can be spent for any of the
following at any time:

-   Attempt a second Learning Target in a given week through
    non-*Checkpoint* means
-   Submit a third AEP (either revision or new submission) in a given
    week
-   Revise an AEP graded "N"
-   Extend the deadline on a *Checkpoint* by 2 hours (request must be
    submitted prior to the original deadline)

To spend a token, please use the *Token Spending form* found on Canvas.
Tokens may not be "stacked". For example, by spending 3 tokens to get a
6-hour *Checkpoint* deadline extension.

Course policies
===============

Technology issues when submitting work
--------------------------------------

WileyPLUS and ORION assignments are submitted electronically. It is the
student's responsibility to make sure these items are submitted on time,
even if technology issues arise. Technology issues that are avoidable or
resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds
for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab
to Canvas and Canvas won't accept the file, you should try again later,
use different browser, or send the file as an email attachment until you
can upload it successfully.

Academic integrity
------------------

Some of the work you will do in the course involves collaboration; at
other times collaboration may be allowed but not required; while at
others it may not be allowed. Here are the rules for collaboration on
each kind of work you do:

-   *Checkpoints* and other work done on Learning Targets: No
    interations at all with another person or with unauthorized sources
    on the internet is allowed. Any evidence of using information from
    another person or source will be investigated as academic
    dishonesty.
-   *AEPs*: Similarly, no interations at all with another person or with
    unauthorized sources on the internet is allowed.
-   *WileyPLUS*: You may discuss the general, broad ideas of WeBWorK
    problems with others but you may not use other people's work as your
    own.

**Please note:** There is no need to commit academic dishonesty in this
class since you can revise and resubmit almost anything. If you come to
believe that cheating or plagiarism is necessary given your situation:
DON'T DO IT. Get some help instead and take comfort in the fact that you
can just submit your best effort, get feedback, and try again later.

All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be thoroughly
investigated, and whether a student has committed academic dishonesty is
my determination to make based on the evidence. If I determine academic
dishonesty has been committed, a report will be filed with the Dean of
Students office, and the minimum penalty will be:

-   grade of "progressing" on Checkpoints and other Learning Target work
    and required expense of two tokens to reattempt; for severe cases,
    you may be barred from reattempting.
-   AEP's: A grade of "N", and you will not be allowed to revise or
    resubmit the AEP for the rest of the semester.

Note these are *minimum* penalties. Academic dishonesty carries with it
strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State policies, including
possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the
university. For details, please see APM 235 by going to
<http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf>.

Dropping the course
-------------------

Dates and details on withdrawing from courses are described on the
[Admissions web
pages](http://fresnostate.edu/studentaffairs/are/registration/add-drop-deadlines.html).

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition
that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly
arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings
and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to
and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The
condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student
must provide documentation that substantiates the condition. Failing or
performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious and
compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction
with the subject matter, class or instructor.

COVID-19 policies and statements
================================

Health screening
----------------

Students who come to campus for face-to-face classes will be required to
