<h1 id="sec:course-goals">Course goals</h1>
<p>CHEM 129A is a two-unit introductory laboratory course in organic chemistry. It is primarily concerned with introducing the tools and techniques that organic chemists use to synthesize and investigate the properties of organic compounds (see the <a href="#slo">list below</a>). Some of these techniques are the same or similar to those you learned in general chemistry courses but may be modified because the experiments use very small amounts of material (micro-scale techniques). Students who successfully complete CHEM 129A generally enroll in CHEM 129B, which further develops students’ laboratory skills. Some students then continue with CHEM 190, undergraduate research or independent study.</p>
<h1 id="sec:slo">Student Learning Outcomes</h1>
<p>Students who successfully complete CHEM 129A should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>work safely in a laboratory;</li>
<li>communicate the structure and properties of organic molecules using common drawing and naming conventions;</li>
<li>analyze chemical structures and reaction conditions to predict the outcome chemical transformations;</li>
<li>maintain an accurate laboratory notebook that would allow a trained organic chemist to reproduce the results of an experiment;</li>
<li>plan an experiment by evaluating the information found in online databases and research articles;</li>
<li>carry out fundamental laboratory techniques such as extraction, crystallization, distillation, chromatography;</li>
<li>measure physical properties of organic compounds including melting and boiling points</li>
<li>assay purity and chemical identity of organic compounds using TLC, GC, and IR</li>
<li>communicate the results of experiments to the instructor and peers in a written form (lab report)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="sec:course-materials">Course materials</h1>
<h2 id="sec:textbook">Textbook</h2>
<p>The face-to-face version of this course is based on the textbook “Micro-scale Approach to Organic Laboratory Techniques” by Pavia et al. Although this title is still listed as the official required course textbook, we are in the process of phasing it out.</p>
<p>If you can obtain a copy of Pavia’s textbook (5th or 6th edition) for affordable price, you can use it in addition to the open access materials listed below.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="sec:laboratory-code-of-safe-practices">Laboratory Code of Safe Practices</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>NO food or drink in the laboratory.</li>
<li>Wear clothing appropriate for laboratory work.</li>
<li>Select and correctly use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).</li>
<li>Know what to do and who to contact in an emergency in the laboratory.</li>
<li>Avoid distractions and be alert to and aware of your surroundings and potential hazards in your area.</li>
<li>Maintain a safe and clean work area.</li>
<li>Only conduct experiments or procedures approved by your lab instructor or research advisor.</li>
<li>Understand the common chemical hazards and hazards specific to the chemicals and procedures with which you are working.</li>
<li>Understand and follow best practices on how to handle, transport, store, and dispose of chemicals safely.</li>
<li>If any equipment, glassware, or procedures are not working properly or as expected, notify your instructor before proceeding.</li>
<li>Notify your instructor if you have, develop, or may develop any medical conditions (e.g. severe asthma, limited mobility, vision impairment, pregnancy, etc) that may affect your safety in the laboratory or sensitivity to chemicals, so that your instructor can properly advise or accommodate you on minimizing the risks associated with laboratory work.</li>
</ol>
<p>These principles will be discussed in detail during the first week of class. More information can be found here: <a href="https://goo.gl/1UFRbo">https://goo.gl/1UFRbo</a>. Also, refer to <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/about/governance/committees/chemicalsafety/publications/acs-safety-guidelines-academic.pdf"><em>Guidelines for Chemical Laboratory Safety in Academic Institutions</em></a> published by American Chemical Society.</p>
<h1 id="sec:expectations">Expectations</h1>
<p>Students are expected to be present during class sessions and come prepared with a basic understanding of the concepts that will allow you to fully participate in discussions. Preparing for the class means making honest effort to learn on your own. This is done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading the assigned material related to the experiment;</li>
<li>preparing the pre-lab assignment;</li>
<li>reviewing the relevant techniques for each experiment (listed in the introduction section for each experiment);</li>
<li>watching videos demonstrating laboratory techniques; and</li>
<li>reviewing safety data sheets (SDS) for chemicals you will be working with.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="sec:types-of-graded-work">Types of graded work</h1>
<h2 id="sec:pre-lab">Pre-lab</h2>
<p>Before carrying out the experiment you will complete a pre-lab assignment to prepare for the scheduled experiment. Pre-lab assignment may include assigned reading, short quiz, pre-experiment documentation (reagent table, risk assessment).</p>
<h2 id="sec:experiments">Experiments</h2>
<p>Majority of the classroom time will be spent on carrying out experiments, making observations, and generating results. Although results and observations are not graded directly, they are important components of post-lab assignments. For example, not making a key observation or obtaining poor quality data may reduce your grade on the experiment.</p>
<h2 id="sec:lab-notebook">Lab notebook</h2>
<p>Assume that you’re in note-taking mode at all time when you are in the lab. Well prepared pre-lab and in-lab notes are very important because they are the basis for the post-lab summary or report that you will be asked to complete.</p>
<p>In-lab notes document what you did in the lab (including notes taken during lecture and discussions) and the results of your experimental work. To know what to write and not to write in the notebook is a balancing act of relevance and brevity. You need write down details that are relevant and necessary for you (or someone else) to reproduce the experiment. Assume that your notes are going to be read by a trained organic chemist. For example, you don’t have to explain what is a round-bottomed flask but you should mention the size of flask, joint size, etd.</p>
<p>Keep all prints (IR and NMR spectra, gas chromatograms, etc.) and sketches of TLC plates as part of you notes portfolio. Your lab notebook is subject to evaluation at any time and must be kept current. Instructions on how to keep laboratory notebook are discussed in the textbook and will be reviewed in the lab. You will submit your in-lab notes for review before you leave the lab room.</p>
<h2 id="sec:post-lab">Post-lab</h2>
<p>Post-lab assignments conclude each experiment. Post-lab will be in a form of a short write-up, formal typed report, or problem set. Details for each post-lab assignment will be posted on Canvas. Document templates will be available for formal lab reports.</p>
<h2 id="sec:exams-and-quizzes">Exams and Quizzes</h2>
<p>Quizzes are short assessments (often multiple-choice) that check your knowledge before the class (based on reading or videos assigned). Exams are longer assessments based on the already covered material and will be take-home assignments</p>
<h1 id="sec:grading">Grading</h1>
<p>Graded assignments are organized into assignment groups (see Table 1) and each group contributes to the final grade.</p>
<p>Points earned for assignments in different categories are not equivalent and should not be treated as such. For example, it may take more work and effort to earn 50 poins for a report than 100 points for completing a simulation.</p>

<h1 id="sec:course-policies">Course policies</h1>
<h2 id="sec:attendance-participation-and-late-workmake-up-policy">Attendance, participation, and late work/make-up policy</h2>
<p>Students are expected to attend and actively participate in all class sessions. The course attendance policy follows university’s <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf">APM 232: Policy on Student Absence</a>.</p>
<p>Late assignments will not be accepted for a grade unless the absence meets the guidelines set forth by the univeristy policy <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf">APM 232: Policy on Student Absence</a></p>
<h2 id="sec:technology-issues-when-submitting-work">Technology issues when submitting work</h2>
<p>For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility to make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary, even if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your responsibility to find another way to get it to the instructor (for example, via an email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try again later or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.</p>
<h2 id="sec:academic-dishonesty">Academic Dishonesty</h2>
<p>For most assignments you are allowed and encouraged to work with others. However, the final product that you submit for feedback must be the result of your own efforts. Therefore you may share ideas and strategies with others, but collaboration on the actual finished product you submit is not allowed. Your work is expected to be the product of your own thinking, written and explained in your own words with no parts of the work copied from external sources such as books or websites, and done clearly enough in your own mind that you could explain the work from start to finish if asked. Specifically, this excludes:</p>
<ul>
<li>copying work from another student;</li>
<li>copying work from a website;</li>
<li>paraphrasing work done by another student or from print or internet resources—i.e. putting it in your own words—without coming up with the main ideas and strategies yourself; and</li>
<li><em>allowing or enabling</em> another student to copy or paraphrase work that you did, even if you did the original work yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Violation of this policy is considered “academic dishonesty” and carries with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State, including possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the university. For details, please see APM 235 by going to <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf">http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>You may feel tempted to academic dishonesty at some point in the semester. The work can be difficult, and many of you are under a lot of stress. If you are considering academic dishonesty, please STOP, take a breath, and remember that your classmates and I want you to succeed in the course. You are not alone, and you have a strong network in the class for getting help. The revision and resubmission policies mean that it’s OK to turn in work that isn’t perfect. There is no need to be academically dishonest! Just do your best on the work, and you’ll have the chance to revise it later.</p>
<h2 id="sec:dropping-the-course-after-the-census-date">Dropping the course after the census date</h2>
<p>A <em>serious and compelling reason</em> is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student’s ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.</p>
<p>Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable “serious and compelling reason” within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.</p>
<h1 id="sec:university-policies-and-disclaimers">University policies and disclaimers</h1>
<h2 id="sec:vaccinations">Vaccinations</h2>
<p>In order to create a safe environment on campus, all students must be vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-02 virus, or obtain an exemption, in order to attend classes on campus or access any services on campus. Documentation of the first dose of the vaccination must be uploaded to the student portal by Aug 20, and documentation of the final dose by Sept 30. Students may request an exemption to the vaccine requirement by going to their student portal to complete the COVID self-certification. Students with vaccination exemptions are subject to weekly COVID testing.</p>
<p>A person is not allowed to come to campus if the person is not been vaccinated, and has not been granted an exemption, or the person has been granted an exemption, but has not tested negative through required weekly testing.</p>
<h2 id="sec:health-screening">Health Screening</h2>
<p>Students who come to campus and/or are participating in off-campus in-person experiential learning will be required to complete a daily health screening before coming to campus or learning site.</p>
<p>A person is not allowed to come to campus if the person is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (vaccinated or not); or the person has tested positive within the past 10 days.</p>
<p>If you have a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19, please complete the campus online reporting form. A campus official will reply to provide guidance and information.</p>
<h2 id="sec:safety-measures">Safety Measures</h2>
<p>Face coverings are required to be worn indoors on-campus and during in-person classes (vaccinated or not), and/or in accordance with learning site requirements if participating in off-campus experiential learning, to reduce the risk of community spread of COVID-19. The Student Health and Counseling Center has complimentary masks available for students who need them. The mask requirement may be modified if/when transmission rates in Fresno Country drop below the threshold identified by the CDC.</p>
<h2 id="sec:students-with-disabilities">Students with disabilities</h2>
<p>Upon identifying themselves to the instructor and the university, students with disabilities will receive reasonable accommodation for learning and evaluation. For more information, contact Services to Students with Disabilities in the Henry Madden Library, Room 1202 (278-2811).</p>
