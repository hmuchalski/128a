<div id="pre-lab">
  <h2>Pre-Lab</h2>
	<p>Before carrying out the experiment you will complete a pre-lab assignment to prepare for the scheduled experiment. Pre-lab assignment may include assigned reading, simulation, short quiz, and preparation of experiment documentation (reagent table, risk assessment).</p>
</div>
<div id="Results">
  <h2>Experiments</h2>
	<p>Majority of the classroom time will be spent on carrying out experiments, making observations, and generating results. Although results and observations are not graded directly, they are important components of post-lab assignments. For example, not making a key observation or obtaining poor quality data may reduce your grade on the experiment.</p>
</div>
<div id="Notebook">
  <h2>Lab Notebook</h2>
<p>You will need a standard examination Blue Book (large size) for each experiment. Assume that you are in note-taking mode at all time when you are in the lab. Well prepared pre-lab and in-lab notes are very important because they are the basis for the post-lab summary or report that you will be asked to complete.</p>
<p>In-lab notes document what you did in the lab (including notes taken during lecture and discussions) and the results of your experimental work. To know what to write and not to write in the notebook is a balancing act of relevance and brevity. You need write down details that are relevant and necessary for you (or someone else) to reproduce the experiment. Assume that your notes are going to be read by a trained organic chemist. For example, you don't have to explain what is a round-bottomed flask but you should mention the size of flask, joint size, etd.</p>
<p>Keep all prints (IR and NMR spectra, gas chromatograms, etc.) and sketches of TLC plates as part of you notes portfolio. Your lab notebook is subject to evaluation at any time and must be kept current. Instructions on how to keep laboratory notebook are discussed in the textbook and will be reviewed in the lab. You will submit your in-lab notes for review before you leave the lab room.</p>
</div>
<div id="post-lab">
  <h2>Post-Lab</h2>
	<p>Post-lab assignments conclude each experiment . Post-lab will be in a form of a short write-up, formal typed report, or problem set. Details for each post-lab assignment will be posted on Canvas. Document templates will be available for formal lab reports.</p>
</div>
<div id="Simulations">
  <h2>Simulations</h2>
  <p>Fresno State continues its partnership with Labster to provide students with virtual experiments. We will use Labster for chemical safety training and then occasionally as homework. Simulations include quiz questions and your overall score is saved to the gradebook after you complete the simulation. You can attempt the simulation multiple times and the best score is kept.
</p>
</div>
<div id="exams">
  <h2>Exams and Quizzes</h2>
<p>Qizzes are short assessments (often multiple-choice) that check your knowledge before the class (based on reading or videos assigned).</p> 
<p>Exams are longer assessments that measure student skills across multiple learning objectives, will require a formal writeup, and may require additional technology. They are likely be administered as at-home assignments to preserve valuable class time</p></div>
