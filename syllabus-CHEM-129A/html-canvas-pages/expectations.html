        <h2>Lab Safety</h2>
        <p>These principles will be discussed in detail during the first week of class. More information can be found here: <a href="https://goo.gl/1UFRbo">https://goo.gl/1UFRbo</a>. Also, refer to <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/about/governance/committees/chemicalsafety/publications/acs-safety-guidelines-academic.pdf"><em>Guidelines for Chemical Laboratory Safety in Academic Institutions</em></a> published by American Chemical Society.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>NO food or drink in the laboratory.</li>
            <li>Wear clothing appropriate for laboratory work.</li>
            <li>Select and correctly use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).</li>
            <li>Know what to do and who to contact in an emergency in the laboratory.</li>
            <li>Avoid distractions and be alert to and aware of your surroundings and potential hazards in your area.</li>
            <li>Maintain a safe and clean work area.</li>
            <li>Only conduct experiments or procedures approved by your lab instructor or research advisor.</li>
            <li>Understand the common chemical hazards and hazards specific to the chemicals and procedures with which you are working.</li>
            <li>Understand and follow best practices on how to handle, transport, store, and dispose of chemicals safely.</li>
            <li>If any equipment, glassware, or procedures are not working properly or as expected, notify your instructor before proceeding.</li>
            <li>Notify your instructor if you have, develop, or may develop any medical conditions (e.g. severe asthma, limited mobility, vision impairment, pregnancy, etc) that may affect your safety in the laboratory or sensitivity to chemicals, so that your instructor can properly advise or accommodate you on minimizing the risks associated with laboratory work.</li>
        </ol>

        <div id="label-2">
            <h2>Students</h2>
            <p>Students are expected to all lab sessions and come prepared with a basic knowledge of the concepts that will allow you to fully participate in discussions. Preparing for the class means making honest effort to learn on your own. This is done by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>reading the assigned material related to the experiment;</li>
                <li>preparing the pre-lab assignment;</li>
                <li>reviewing the relevant techniques for each experiment (listed in the introduction section for each experiment);</li>
                <li>watching videos demonstrating laboratory techniques; and</li>
                <li>reviewing safety data sheets (SDS) for chemicals you will be working with.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will not be allowed to enter the lab if a) you are late and missed the pre-lab discussion; b) you are not appropriately dressed to work in the lab; or 3) you don't complete the pre-lab assignment.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="label-3">
            <h2>Instructor</h2>
            <p>My primary responsibility is to create a learning environment where it&rsquo;s safe to take intellectual risks without shaming or judgment, and to give you feedback and guidance as you grow in your understanding of the subject. I am also responsible for enforcing laboratory and health safety for the benefit of all participants in the course. If you perceive that I am falling short in my responsibilities, you have the right and responsibility to give constructive feedback that helps me improve. I will consider all reasonable suggestions in the course regarding my instruction.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="workload">
            <h2>Workload</h2>
            <p>Two 170-minute lab meetings per week (Monday and Wednesday) where we experimentally explore selected organic chemistry concepts (5â€“6 hours per week). Attendance is mandatory because you must complete all experiments to obtain a passing grade. Typically, the in-lab session will start with a short review of relevant material, concepts, and chemical safety through group discussions and problem-solving activities.</p>
            <p>If you cannot attend a lab you must notify your instructor and lab coordinator as soon as possible explaining why you have to miss the lab. Arranging make-ups is very difficult because every semester all lab sections are at full capacity. If your request is approved you are still required to document the reason for missing the lab, and will be expected to make the lab up and complete the assigned work. If the above conditions are not met, you will receive 0 for the missed lab.</p>

        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>Please remember that the same student conduct rules for in-person classroom instruction also apply for virtual/online classrooms. Students are prohibited from any unauthorized recording, dissemination, or publication of any academic presentation, including any online classroom instruction, for any commercial purpose. In addition, students may not record or use virtual/online instruction in any manner that would violate copyright laws. Students are to use all online/virtual instruction exclusively for the educational purpose of the online class in which the instruction is being provided. Students may not record any online recordings or post any online recordings on any other format (e.g., electronic, video, social media, audio recording, web page, internet, hard paper copy, etc.) for any purpose without the explicit written permission of the faculty member providing the instruction. Exceptions for disability-related accommodations will be addressed by Student Disability Services working in conjunction with the student and faculty member.</p>

                </a>
            </p>
            <p>Keep the following guidelines in mind as you voice your opinion and personal thoughts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identify yourself by your real name.</strong> Be mindful of your personal safety, and avoid including personal information, such as phone numbers or addresses, in discussion forums. All online communications should be transmitted with the intent to inform, inspire, etc. - not to offend or breach personal privacy. Never use private information about other individuals and be sensitive to the information you share about yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>Write in the first person</strong> (this is your opinion).</li>
                <li><strong>Use humor, joking, or sarcasm with caution.</strong> We often rely on non-verbal cues such as facial expressions to communicate joking or sarcasm, but these cues are not always clear in an online environment. These cues can be simulated with emoticons to reduce misunderstandings.</li>
                <li><strong>What you write is public&mdash;respect your audience and be mindful of proper netiquette.</strong> Netiquette, also known as 'net etiquette,' includes using language free of profanity, proper tone and mechanics (including full sentences), as well as courtesy and respect for others' opinions. Instructors may interpret breaches of netiquette as "disruptive behavior."</li>
                <li><strong>Be Professional, Clear and Respectful.</strong> Clear and effective writing translates to clear and effective communication. Writing the way you would speak is a good rule of thumb, use a positive tone and adhere to the same rules you would follow in face-to-face communications. As well, use proper grammar, spelling, and formatting - checking all communications before sending. Check messages and respond in a prompt manner. Your professional image is an important part of credibility and all of your communications will factor into the big picture.</li>
                <li><strong>Read and Formulate Communications Carefully.</strong> Take the time to think about the information contained in all of your online communications. This will allow you to thoughtfully consider all points, reduces confusion and prepares you for a valid response. You can in return, research your facts and provide citations for information stated in your communications. This promotes a robust academic environment and adds credibility to any course. Re-read all communications before sending to avoid emotional and or "all capital letter" statements and keep communications meaningful and to the point.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Tolerant and Cooperative.</strong> Keep in mind that every student is participating to learn and anyone can make a simple mistake in research, knowledge or communication. Address the idea/concept, not the person. Keep an open mind and focus on the task at hand - learning. When adverse conditions arise and communications get strained - try to help rather than hinder. True cooperation means working together to the same end - everyone wants to be successful in any given course.</li>
                <li><strong>Remember This Course is Online.</strong> Your instructor and fellow students may be located around the world or have very different schedules than you do. You may not always receive an immediate response. Make sure you plan for this and don&rsquo;t put things off until the last moment.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Proper Headings and Subject Lines.</strong> Emails and Discussion Forum topics should have subject lines that reflect the content of your message. &ldquo;My Week 1 Reflections&rdquo; is better than &ldquo;submission&rdquo; and &ldquo;Week 3 Reading is Missing&rdquo; is better than &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; Provide Context For Your Responses. If you are sending a reply to a message or a posting to be sure you summarize the original at the top of the message or include just enough text of the original to give a context. This will make sure readers understand when they start to read your response. Giving context helps everyone.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide Enough Detail in Your Messages.</strong> When asking for help, either from your instructor or from technical support, be sure to provide as much information as possible in order to help resolve the issue. Make sure to include the course name and activity name, what you were attempting to do, the full text of error messages and your browser/version information (if a technical issue), a screenshot displaying the problem, and any other relevant information. It may take a little more time up-front to compose your question, but it can help to eliminate some of the back and forth communication.</li>
