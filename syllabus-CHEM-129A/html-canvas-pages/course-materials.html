  <h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>The face-to-face version of this course is based on the textbook &#8220;Micro-scale Approach to Organic Laboratory Techniques&#8221;, 6th edition, by Pavia et al. Although this title is still listed as the official required course textbook, <em>we are in the process of phasing it out</em>.</p>

<p>Experiment procedures excerpted from the textbook will be posted on Canvas. If you can obtain a copy of Pavia&#8217;s textbook (5th or 6th edition) for affordable price, consider purchasing it as you will have one central reference which you can use it in addition to the open access materials listed below.</p>
