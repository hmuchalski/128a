# Course goals

CHEM 129A is a two-unit introductory laboratory course in organic
chemistry. It is primarily concerned with introducing the tools and
techniques that organic chemists use to synthesize and investigate the
properties of organic compounds (see the [list below](#slo)). Some of
these techniques are the same or similar to those you learned in general
chemistry courses but may be modified because the experiments use very
small amounts of material (micro-scale techniques). Students who
successfully complete CHEM 129A generally enroll in CHEM 129B, which
further develops students' laboratory skills. Some students then
continue with CHEM 190, undergraduate research or independent study.

# Student Learning Outcomes {#slo}

Students who successfully complete CHEM 129A should be able to:

-   work safely in a laboratory;
-   communicate the structure and properties of organic molecules using
    common drawing and naming conventions;
-   analyze chemical structures and reaction conditions to predict the
    outcome chemical transformations;
-   maintain an accurate laboratory notebook that would allow a trained
    organic chemist to reproduce the results of an experiment;
-   plan an experiment by evaluating the information found in online
    databases and research articles;
-   carry out fundamental laboratory techniques such as extraction,
    crystallization, distillation, chromatography;
-   measure physical properties of organic compounds including melting
    and boiling points
-   assay purity and chemical identity of organic compounds using TLC,
    GC, and IR
-   communicate the results of experiments to the instructor and peers
    in a written form (lab report)

# Course materials

## Textbook

The face-to-face version of this course is based on the textbook
"Micro-scale Approach to Organic Laboratory Techniques" by Pavia et
al. Although this title is still listed as the official required course
textbook, we are in the process of phasing it out.

If you can obtain a copy of Pavia's textbook (5th or 6th edition) for
affordable price, you can use it in addition to the open access
materials listed below.

# Laboratory Code of Safe Practices

1.  NO food or drink in the laboratory.
2.  Wear clothing appropriate for laboratory work.
3.  Select and correctly use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment
    (PPE).
4.  Know what to do and who to contact in an emergency in the
    laboratory.
5.  Avoid distractions and be alert to and aware of your surroundings
    and potential hazards in your area.
6.  Maintain a safe and clean work area.
7.  Only conduct experiments or procedures approved by your lab
    instructor or research advisor.
8.  Understand the common chemical hazards and hazards specific to the
    chemicals and procedures with which you are working.
9.  Understand and follow best practices on how to handle, transport,
    store, and dispose of chemicals safely.
10. If any equipment, glassware, or procedures are not working properly
    or as expected, notify your instructor before proceeding.
11. Notify your instructor if you have, develop, or may develop any
    medical conditions (e.g. severe asthma, limited mobility, vision
    impairment, pregnancy, etc) that may affect your safety in the
    laboratory or sensitivity to chemicals, so that your instructor can
    properly advise or accommodate you on minimizing the risks
    associated with laboratory work.

These principles will be discussed in detail during the first week of
class. More information can be found here: <https://goo.gl/1UFRbo>.
Also, refer to [*Guidelines for Chemical Laboratory Safety in Academic
Institutions*](https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/about/governance/committees/chemicalsafety/publications/acs-safety-guidelines-academic.pdf)
published by American Chemical Society.

# Expectations

Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic this class is delivered
virtually in a blended mode, as a combination of synchronous and
asynchronous activities. Activities planned for synchronous meetings
will rely on breakout rooms. Although the sessions may be recorded,
activities within breakout rooms are not being recorded.

Students are expected to be present during virtual class sessions
equipped with a basic understanding of the concepts that will allow you
to fully participate in discussions. Preparing for the class means
making honest effort to learn on your own. This is done by:

-   reading the assigned material related to the experiment;
-   preparing the pre-lab assignment;
-   reviewing the relevant techniques for each experiment (listed in the
    introduction section for each experiment);
-   watching videos demonstrating laboratory techniques; and
-   reviewing safety data sheets (SDS) for chemicals you will be working
    with.

# Types of graded work

## Pre-lab

Before carrying out the experiment you will complete a pre-lab
assignment to prepare for the scheduled experiment. Pre-lab assignment
may include assigned reading, short quiz, pre-experiment documentation
(reagent table, risk assessment).

## Experiments

Majority of the classroom time will be spent on carrying out
experiments, making observations, and generating results. Although
results and observations are not graded directly, they are important
components of post-lab assignments. For example, not making a key
observation or obtaining poor quality data may reduce your grade on the
experiment.

## Lab notebook

Assume that you're in note-taking mode at all time when you are in the
lab. Well prepared pre-lab and in-lab notes are very important because
they are the basis for the post-lab summary or report that you will be
asked to complete.

In-lab notes document what you did in the lab (including notes taken
during lecture and discussions) and the results of your experimental
work. To know what to write and not to write in the notebook is a
balancing act of relevance and brevity. You need write down details that
are relevant and necessary for you (or someone else) to reproduce the
experiment. Assume that your notes are going to be read by a trained
organic chemist. For example, you don't have to explain what is a
round-bottomed flask but you should mention the size of flask, joint
size, etd.

Keep all prints (IR and NMR spectra, gas chromatograms, etc.) and
sketches of TLC plates as part of you notes portfolio. Your lab notebook
is subject to evaluation at any time and must be kept current.
Instructions on how to keep laboratory notebook are discussed in the
textbook and will be reviewed in the lab. You will submit your in-lab
notes for review before you leave the lab room.

## Post-lab

Post-lab assignments conclude each experiment. Post-lab will be in a
form of a short write-up, formal typed report, or problem set. Details
for each post-lab assignment will be posted on Canvas. Document
templates will be available for formal lab reports.

## Exams and Quizzes

Quizzes are short assessments (often multiple-choice) that check your
knowledge before the class (based on reading or videos assigned). Exams
are longer assessments based on the already covered material and will be
take-home assignments

# Grading

Graded assignments are organized into assignment groups (see
[@tbl:assignments]) and each group contributes to the final grade.

Points earned for assignments in different categories are not equivalent
and should not be treated as such. For example, it may take more work
and effort to earn 50 poins for a report than 100 points for completing
a simulation.

  Assignment Group                     
  ------------------------------------ ------
  Chemical Safety                      5%
  Language of organic chemistry        5%
  Solubility                           6%
  Crystallization                      6%

  Chromatography                       6%
  Distillation                         6%
  Analytical techniques (GC, IR)       6%
  Synthesis of acetaminophen           6%
  Synthesis of isoamyl acetate         6%
  Nucleophilic substitution            6%
  Grignard synthesis of benzoic acid   6%
  Take-home exams (4)                  20%
  Practicals (2)                       10%
  Perusall reading (extra credit)      3%
  **TOTAL**                            103%

  : Assignment groups and their weights {#tbl:assignments}

Final grade will be determined based on overall performance according to
the table below ([@tbl:letter-grades]).

# Course policies

## Attendance, participation, and late work/make-up policy

Students are expected to attend and actively participate in all virtual
class sessions. The course attendance policy follows university's [APM
232: Policy on Student
Absence](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf).

Late assignments will not be accepted for a grade unless the absence
meets the guidelines set forth by the univeristy policy [APM 232: Policy
on Student
Absence](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf)

## Technology issues when submitting work

For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility to
make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary, even
if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your
responsibility to find another way to get it to the instructor (for
example, via an email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable
or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid
grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to
upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won't accept the file, you should try
again later or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload
it successfully.

## Academic Dishonesty

For most assignments you are allowed and encouraged to work with others.
However, the final product that you submit for feedback must be the
result of your own efforts. Therefore you may share ideas and strategies
with others, but collaboration on the actual finished product you submit
is not allowed. Your work is expected to be the product of your own
thinking, written and explained in your own words with no parts of the
work copied from external sources such as books or websites, and done
clearly enough in your own mind that you could explain the work from
start to finish if asked. Specifically, this excludes:

-   copying work from another student;
-   copying work from a website;
-   paraphrasing work done by another student or from print or internet
    resources---i.e. putting it in your own words---without coming up
    with the main ideas and strategies yourself; and
-   *allowing or enabling* another student to copy or paraphrase work
    that you did, even if you did the original work yourself.

Violation of this policy is considered "academic dishonesty" and carries
with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State, including
possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the
university. For details, please see APM 235 by going to
<http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf>.

You may feel tempted to academic dishonesty at some point in the
semester. The work can be difficult, and many of you are under a lot of
stress. If you are considering academic dishonesty, please STOP, take a
breath, and remember that your classmates and I want you to succeed in
the course. You are not alone, and you have a strong network in the
class for getting help. The revision and resubmission policies mean that
it's OK to turn in work that isn't perfect. There is no need to be
academically dishonest! Just do your best on the work, and you'll have
the chance to revise it later.

## Dropping the course after the census date

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition
that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly
arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings
and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to
and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The
condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student
must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.

Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious
and compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is
dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.

# University policies and disclaimers

## Vaccinations

In order to create a safe environment on campus, all students must be
vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-02 virus, or obtain an exemption, in
order to attend classes on campus or access any services on campus.
Documentation of the first dose of the vaccination must be uploaded to
the student portal by Aug 20, and documentation of the final dose by
Sept 30. Students may request an exemption to the vaccine requirement by
going to their student portal to complete the COVID self-certification.
Students with vaccination exemptions are subject to weekly COVID
testing.

A person is not allowed to come to campus if the person is not been
vaccinated, and has not been granted an exemption, or the person has
been granted an exemption, but has not tested negative through required
weekly testing.

## Health Screening

Students who come to campus and/or are participating in off-campus
in-person experiential learning will be required to complete a daily
health screening before coming to campus or learning site.

A person is not allowed to come to campus if the person is experiencing
COVID-19 symptoms (vaccinated or not); or the person has tested positive
within the past 10 days.

If you have a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19, please complete
the campus online reporting form. A campus official will reply to
provide guidance and information.

## Safety Measures

Face coverings are required to be worn indoors on-campus and during
in-person classes (vaccinated or not), and/or in accordance with
learning site requirements if participating in off-campus experiential
learning, to reduce the risk of community spread of COVID-19. The
Student Health and Counseling Center has complimentary masks available
for students who need them. The mask requirement may be modified if/when
transmission rates in Fresno Country drop below the threshold identified
by the CDC.

## Students with disabilities

Upon identifying themselves to the instructor and the university,
students with disabilities will receive reasonable accommodation for
learning and evaluation. For more information, contact Services to
Students with Disabilities in the Henry Madden Library, Room 1202
(278-2811).
