<h1 id="course-description">Course description</h1>
<p>The goal of this course is to help students understand the fundamentals of presenting an effective research seminar. Graduate students should also become competent in participating in the scientific discussion of research papers and presentations with their colleagues and visiting research scholars. This course also focuses on getting the student ready to present a literature survey of a research topic and an overview of the planned/completed research project. Students will learn by attending all the departmental seminars and in conjunction with discussions on the topic with their respective thesis mentor and seminar coordinator.</p>
<h2 id="literature-seminar-and-thesis-defense">Literature seminar and thesis defense</h2>
<p>Students in the M.S. Program give two seminars while in the graduate program, a literature review seminar (this course, CHEM 280) and a thesis defense seminar (1 unit of CHEM 299). The literature review seminar ought to be presented prior to a student’s advancement to candidacy and the topic should not be directly related to the student’s thesis research. Topic should be discussed and approved by student’s thesis advisor and the CHEM 280 coordinator.</p>
<p>A graduate student needs to attended at least seven (7) departmental seminars before requesting permission to enroll in CHEM 280.</p>
<h1 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h1>
<p>By the end of this course, graduate students should be able to identify and collect the required content related to the topic and present it clearly and logically to a wider audience comprising of the students (undergraduate and graduate) and faculty.</p>
<p>For undergraduate students enrolled in CHEM 180H the learning objective of this course is to get better at learning from a research presentation be able to summarize the contents using scientific language. This skill will be practiced through written assignments and will be complemented with a research report at the end.</p>
<h1 id="course-requirements">Course requirements</h1>
<p>Graduate students (CHEM 280) are expected to prepare and present a seminar talk that is 30–40 min long with 10 min for Q&amp;A. The topic <em>should not</em> be directly related to the student’s thesis research.</p>
<p>Honors students are expected to prepare and present a seminar talk that is 15-20 min long with 5 min for Q&amp;A. The talk <em>should</em> describe the background, aims, and results of your Honors research project.</p>
<p>The presentation comprises 75% of the final trade in this course. Content and delivery of your presentation will be evaluated by the faculty attending the seminar and by the faculty coordinating the seminar using the rubric attached to this document. Failure to present will result in a failing grade for the course. A student, who registers for this course in a given semester, must give his/her seminar during that semester.</p>
<p>Attendance (15%) and participation (10%) are the remaining elements of the final grade.</p>

<p>This syllabus and schedule are subject to change in the event of extenuating circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
<p>Attendance is mandatory for all students unless there is a compelling reason preventing it. There will be a sign-in sheet for each seminar date.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h2>
<p>The research talk you present must be the result of your own efforts. Therefore you may share ideas and strategies with other students and your advisor, but collaboration on the finished presentation is not allowed. Your work is expected to be the product of your own research, thinking and presented in your own words.</p>
<p>Violation of this policy is considered “academic dishonesty” and carries with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State, including possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the university.
