Introduction
============

When you took the sophomore course in organic chemistry, you studied the
typical reactions of halooalkanes, alkenes/alkynes, aromatic compounds
and organic carbonyl compounds, etc. That was to introduce you to
compound classes and to give you an understanding of how and why such
reactions occur. However, the course did not focus how to design a
synthetic route to prepare a given organic compound from readily
available starting materials. This is a crucial aspect of organic
chemistry. The design and synthesis of novel organic compounds is
fundamental to the development of new medicines, agrochemicals,
plastics, dyestuffs, etc. This course will introduce you to the ideas
involved in synthetic design, particularly 'retrosynthetic analysis'
(RSA).

Student Learning Outcomes {#slo}
-------------------------

Students who successfully complete this course should be able to:

-   be familiar with the terminology of retrosynthetic analysis (RSA);
-   distinguish factors such as chemoselectivity, regioselectivity,
    stereoselectivity and protecting group methodology and their
    importance in synthetic design;
-   identify synthons and their synthetic equivalents and functional
    group interconversions;
-   use RSA to design and evaluate syntheses of target molecules of
    medium complexity
-   evaluate a synthetic plan and identify flaws in synthetic design
-   propose a plausible reaction mechanism for a given reactions

Topics
------

-   Retrosynthetic Analysis (RSA)
-   Disconnection via Functional Group Interconversion
-   Protecting Groups
-   Carbon--Carbon Bond Disconnections
-   Synthesis of Compounds Containing Rings
-   Stereochemistry: Prediction and Control
-   Cross-Coupling Reactions
-   Two-Direactional Synthesis
-   Catalysis

What to expect
==============

The learning mode that will dominate our class meetings is deep analysis
of published syntheses of case studies. The goal of this course is not
to cover all strategies and tactics used in organic synthesis but to
provide opportunities for development of a skill which you need to
master as a graduate student: to quickly learn complex and unfamiliar
science topics to the degree that you can teach them to others.

Active participation in class discussions is key to getting the most out
of this class. Expect to be called to the board on a weekly basis to
discuss synthetic and mechanistic problems. Don't be concerned if you
feel weak in some areas. By working through a problem you will
strengthen your understanding and refine thinking process. This means
that it is of utter importance that you come to class prepared.

Reading, researching, and working through problems should be your
primary out-of-class activities.

Types of graded work
====================

There are three types of graded work you will encounter in this course:

1.  Problem sets
2.  Midterm take-home exam
3.  Synthesis proposal
4.  Proposal presentation

Problem sets are written homework assignments containing synthetic
problems and mechanisms. We will review some of those problems and
students will be asked to go to the board and solve the problem in front
of the group. Thus, just having the answer may not be sufficient to
receive full credit on the assignment if you are not able to develop the
solution again.

The take-home exam will be just like problem sets but bigger (more
problems) and more comprehensive.

Each student will also propose total synthesis of natural product and
present it to the class.

Final letter grade scheme
=========================

Grade brackets are imposed by course coordinator. In the past, the
grading scale followed a pattern close to the following: A = 90--100, B
80--89, C 70--79; D 60--69; and F \<60.

  Grade component          Subtotal
  ------------------------ ----------
  Problem Sets             50%
  Midterm take-home exam   20%
  Synthesis Proposal       15%
  Presentation             15%

Course policies
===============

Technology issues when submitting work
--------------------------------------

For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility to
make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary, even
if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your
responsibility to find another way to get it to me (for example, via an
email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with
a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline
extension.

Academic Dishonesty
-------------------

For most assignments you are allowed and encouraged to work with others.
However, the final product that you submit for feedback must be the
result of your own efforts. Therefore you may share ideas and strategies
with others, but collaboration on the actual finished product you submit
is not allowed. Your work is expected to be the product of your own
thinking, written and explained in your own words with no parts of the
work copied from external sources such as books or websites, and done
clearly enough in your own mind that you could explain the work from
start to finish if asked. Specifically, this excludes:

-   copying work from another student;
-   copying work from a website;
-   paraphrasing work done by another student or from print or internet
    resources---i.e. putting it in your own words---without coming up
    with the main ideas and strategies yourself; and
-   *allowing or enabling* another student to copy or paraphrase work
    that you did, even if you did the original work yourself.

Violation of this policy is considered "academic dishonesty" and carries
with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State, including
possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the
university. For details, please see APM 235 by going to
<http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf>.

You may feel tempted to academic dishonesty at some point in the
semester. The work can be difficult, and many of you are under a lot of
stress. If you are considering academic dishonesty, please STOP, take a
breath, and remember that your classmates and I want you to succeed in
the course. You are not alone, and you have a strong network in the
class for getting help.

Dropping the course after the census date
-----------------------------------------

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition
that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly
arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings
and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to
and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The
condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student
must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.

Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious
and compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is
dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.
