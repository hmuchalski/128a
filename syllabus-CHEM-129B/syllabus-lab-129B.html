<h2 id="note-about-the-duration-of-a-lab-session-">Note about the duration of a lab session <!-- omit from toc --></h2>
<p>The CSU defines <em>one class hour</em> as 50 minutes of instruction, which is the default duration for a 1-unit lecture. Science laboratories fall under the category of <em>supervision courses</em> (<a href="https://academics.fresnostate.edu/scheduling/documents/CourseClassificationSystem%201.3.18.pdf">C16 category</a>). For laboratory sessions, 1 unit corresponds to 3 <em>class hours</em>, totaling 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of instruction or supervision. It's worth noting that this differs from the duration indicated in the catalog (2 hours and 50 minutes), as university regulations stipulate a 10-minute break after each 50 minutes of instruction. However, adhering to fixed break times presents challenges in a lab setting where students or groups work at individual paces, and interrupting for breaks might be impractical or unsafe. Consequently, while the official lab time is listed as 13:00–15:50, our goal is to conclude each lab session by 15:30, ensuring a full 150 minutes of instruction or supervision.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-course">About the course</h2>
<p>The aim of this course is to inspire students to explore the breadth of organic chemistry, fostering an understanding of its principles and their practical application. This, in turn, equips students with a functional knowledge and genuine appreciation of organic structure and reactivity. In the second semester of the sequence, the emphasis shifts towards the pivotal role of experimentation in gaining molecular insights. This involves correlating molecular structure, reactivity, and function through the use of wet chemical methods and spectroscopy.</p>
<p>CHEM 129B is the second part of the 2-semester sequence in organic chemistry laboratory. As such it is primarily concerned with introducing intermediate level concepts and techniques used in organic chemistry. We will continue to use the techniques covered in the first semester lab and will introduce additional methods and techniques such as NMR spectroscopy, multi-step synthesis, green chemistry, and chemical literature.</p>
<h3 id="assumed-prior-knowledge-and-skills">Assumed prior knowledge and skills</h3>
<p>The formal pre-requisite to enroll in CHEM 129B is passing CHEM 129A (or equivalent) with a grade of &quot;C&quot; or better. In practice it means that students who enroll in CHEM 129B should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>communicate the structure and properties of organic molecules using common drawing and naming conventions;</li>
<li>conduct laboratory work of high quality including handling chemicals and other laboratory hazards in a safe, ethical, and socially responsible manner;</li>
<li>use basic laboratory techniques such as extraction, crystallization, filtration, distillation, column chromatography, TLC; and</li>
<li>measure melting point and acquire IR spectrum of a sample.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-learning-outcomes">Course Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Upon completion of this course students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep accurate, clear, concise, and complete records of their laboratory work in a notebook that would allow a trained organic chemist to reproduce the results.</li>
<li>Use standard laboratory equipment and instruments, and evaluate the reliability and significance of laboratory data, all within professional ethical guidelines.</li>
<li>Use online databases to find relevant research articles containing information such as physical and chemical properties of organic molecules, synthetic procedures, and spectroscopic data.</li>
<li>Plan a synthesis experiment by evaluating the information found in online databases and research articles</li>
<li>Carry out an experimental procedure to synthesize, isolate, purify, and analyze the product of chemical synthesis</li>
<li>Analyze the results of an experiment and be able to identify sources of error and suggest improvements;</li>
<li>Interpret spectroscopic data of organic compounds to confirm the structure of organic compounds</li>
<li>Communicate the results of experiments to the instructor and peers in a written form (lab report) and presentation (slide deck or poster).</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details refer to <a href="/a5Vq_rZQRI2_f6ylivvNiA">Department Student Learning Outcomes</a> modeled after <a href="https://www.acs.org/education/policies/acs-approval-program/guidelines.html">ACS Guidelines for Bachelor’s Degree Programs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="course-materials-and-technology">Course materials and technology</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Techniques Reference Manual</strong> <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Book:_Organic_Chemistry_Lab_Techniques_(Nichols)">LibreTexts e-book by Lisa Nichols</a> is our recommended reference for laboratory techniques. The textbook by Pavia et al. is listed as the official textbook for this course, but we are in the process of phasing it out. If you own a copy of Pavia's textbook (5th or 6th edition), then feel free to use it in addition to the LibreTexts option</li>
<li><strong>Personal protective equipment (PPE)</strong>: Lab coat and approved safety goggles. Disposable nitrile gloves will be provided.</li>
<li><strong>Canvas:</strong> The central repository for all course materials and information is our <a href="https://fresnostate.instructure.com/courses/76128">Canvas site</a> which will be the main repository for assignments, grades, and links to materials/resources.</li>
<li><strong>Document scanning tool</strong>: Most documents you will turn in for feedback and grading will be submitted electronically but prepared on paper. A smartphone with a scanning app can be used to convert paper documents into PDFs. There are number of free options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that you like and learn how to use it.</li>
<li><strong>Personal computer:</strong> You will need a x86 class personal computer<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> that can run standalone desktop applications. Mobile devices can be used but they are inferior or incompatible with software we will use.</li>
<li><strong>Zoom:</strong> Virtual meetings (if any) will be held via Zoom. Links and passwords to zoom meetings will be published on Canvas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-workflow">Course workflow</h2>
<p>Activities in this course follows a cyclical pattern. Over the semester you will engage in 5 experimental modules and an independent research project. At the heart of each module is a synthesis of an organic compound (1–3 steps). Specific requirements will be communicated by the instructor at the beginning of the semester.</p>
<p><strong>Before class</strong>, your task will be to prepare for the experiment by studying the relevant reactions and mechanisms, lab techniques, and safety information about chemicals you will be work-ing with. Your instructor may assign graded pre-lab assignment to help you prepare for the lab.</p>
<p><strong>Class time</strong> will be focused primarily on doing experiments, making observations, generating results, processing spectroscopic data, and group discussions. Results and observations made during lab are important inputs for writing post-lab reports. For example, not making a key observation or obtaining poor quality data may reduce your grade on the experiment because you will not have all information to write the lab report or discuss the results.</p>
<p><strong>After class</strong> you will work on finalizing the documentation related to the experiment, usually in a form of typed lab report. Details for each post-lab assignment will be posted on Can-vas by the instructor. Document templates will be available for formal lab reports.</p>
<h2 id="on-keeping-records-lab-notebook">On keeping records (lab notebook)</h2>
<p>The human brain is both the least reliable whiteboard and the least dependable alarm clock. It's crucial to acknowledge that memories of your actions and observations in the lab can fade rapidly once you step away. To counteract this, it's essential to document your experiences in real time, as these notes (combined with pre-lab documentation) will serve as the foundation for your subsequent post-lab tasks, such as reports and presentations.</p>
<p>Maintain a comprehensive record of what you did and observed. Also keep all physical copies such as IR and NMR spectra, gas chromatograms, and sketches of TLC plates. These components contribute to your experimental record. Remember that your lab notes are subject to evaluation at any point and should remain up-to-date. Your instructor will provide guidelines on how to maintain your laboratory notebook at the start of the semester. Be prepared to submit your in-lab notes for assessment before concluding your time in the lab. your time in the lab.</p>
<h3 id="lab-notes-guiding-principles">Lab notes guiding principles</h3>
<p>Lab notes should document what you did, how you did it, what you observed, and the data you collected. Knowing what to include and exclude in your notebook involves a balancing act between relevance and brevity. You need to record details that are pertinent and necessary for someone else to replicate your work. This hypothetical chemist won't have the opportunity to consult with you or access any auxiliary documentation you used during the experiment. Therefore, you must provide clear descriptions of your actions and methods.</p>
<p>Lab notes should be easy to read—use paragraph breaks, headings, etc. to help the reader navigate the notebook.</p>
<p>It is safe to assume, however, that the reader of your notes has been trained in basic organic laboratory techniques. For instance, you don’t need to explain how to perform a recrystallization because the intended reader should already be familiar with the process (and if not, they can refer to a techniques manual). What will be beneficial to them are the specific details related to the particular recrystallization: the solvent used, approximate volume of solvent, and the duration it took for cooling and crystal growth.</p>
<p>Contrary to common belief, reproducible and detailed lab notes don’t have to be lengthy or time-consuming. Here's an example statement that captures all the crucial information without being overly verbose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The crude product (sticky brown solid, 1.23 g) was recrystallized from hot ethanol (15 mL) in an Erlenmeyer flask. After cooling to rt and then to 0 °C, the solid was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with ice-cold water, and dried in air for 1 h to give the product as a white crystalline solid (0.38 g), mp 87–89 °C.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another benefit of recording everything in real time is that it can help you identify errors, explain unexpected outcomes, and troubleshoot experiments that go awry. In the recrystallization process described above, the mass recovery is notably low. A chemist repeating the experiment might decide to use less ethanol (or a different solvent) to enhance the mass recovery.</p>
<h2 id="assessments-and-grading">Assessments and grading</h2>
<p>The final grade in the course will be based on your work in three areas (see table below). There will be five experiment sets, independent project, and quizzes. Each experiment set will have variety of graded work (pre-lab, lab notebook, report, and other assignments) that add contributes to the 13% value for each lab set.</p>

<h3 id="grading-philosophy">Grading philosophy</h3>
<p>:::warning
Grading in this course is different than you might be used to. Please read this section carefully and ask questions as needed.
:::</p>
<p>As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that <em>learning takes time</em> and that grading your work based on a single point of data, such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps unethical. A truly valid measure of learning has to involve <em>multiple attempts</em> that allow you to learn from your past mistakes and demonstrate not only your skill, but also your growth. I believe your work should be evaluated by just like everyone else's work in the real world is evaluated, i.e., by giving you <em>clearly defined standards</em> for quality, <em>detailed verbal feedback</em> on your work, and <em>opportunities to try again</em> based on the feedback. This gets you into a <em>feedback loop</em>, a conversation between you and me about your work, that continues until your work meets the standards (or we reach the end of the semester). In light of the principles outlined above, in this course students can <em>revise and resubmit some of their work</em>, several times over if needed, using the feedback at each stage to improve and grow.</p>
<h3 id="grading-of-experiments">Grading of experiments</h3>
<p>You will receive feedback and marks on work that you produce in- and outside the lab. Those include pre-lab documentation, experimental notes and observations, results (yield, spectroscopic data), and written lab report. Each of the regular experiments contributes 13% to the final grade and will have several components (see table below for details).</p>

<h3 id="grading-of-lab-reports-and-the-emrn-rubric">Grading of lab reports and the EMRN rubric</h3>
<p>One of the main objectives of this course is for you to learn to interpret and communicate experimental results. This is a difficult skill that needs to be developed over time through iteration and feedback loops. At the end of each module you will submit a formal lab report, short version for the first two modules, and more extensive for modules 3-5. Each experiment will end with submission of a written lab report which will be evaluated using &quot;EMRN&quot; rubric shown below.</p>
<p><img src="http://rtalbert.org/content/images/2022/04/EMRN-rubric-2020.png" alt="EMPX rubric"></p>
<p>Each lab report can be revised and resubmitted before the grade becomes final. Deadlines and conditions for submission of revised reports will be communicated in Canvas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grade &quot;E&quot; or &quot;M&quot; receives full score (4%)</li>
<li>Grade &quot;R&quot; will receive partial score (2%) with an option to revise and resubmit.</li>
<li>Grade &quot;N&quot; will receive partial score (1%) with an option to revise and resubmit but the feedback will be very limited.</li>
<li>No report will not receive credit (0%). Submissions after the deadline will be reviewed as-is with no possibility for revision and resubmission.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="research-project">Research project</h3>
<p>During the final five weeks of the semester, students will engage in an autonomous research project known as a CURE (Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience). The instructor will not provide the project's objective and methods, and the outcomes are either entirely unknown or only partially revealed. To accomplish the project, students will conduct comprehensive literature research to gather the essential information required for the synthesis. The culmination of this endeavor will involve delivering a presentation to the class.</p>
<h3 id="letter-grades">Letter grades</h3>
<p>Final grade will be determined based on overall performance according to the weights in the table above.</p>

<ol>
<li>NO food or drink in the laboratory.</li>
<li>Wear clothing appropriate for laboratory work.</li>
<li>Select and correctly use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).</li>
<li>Know what to do and who to contact in an emergency in the laboratory.</li>
<li>Avoid distractions and be alert to and aware of your surroundings and potential hazards in your area.</li>
<li>Maintain a safe and clean work area.</li>

<li>Understand the common chemical hazards and hazards specific to the chemicals and procedures with which you are working.</li>
<li>Understand and follow best practices on how to handle, transport, store, and dispose of chemicals safely.</li>
<li>If any equipment, glassware, or procedures are not working properly or as expected, notify your instructor before proceeding.</li>
<li>Notify your instructor if you have, develop, or may develop any medical conditions (e.g. severe asthma, limited mobility, vision impairment, pregnancy, etc) that may affect your safety in the laboratory or sensitivity to chemicals, so that your instructor can properly advise or accommodate you on minimizing the risks associated with laboratory work.</li>
</ol>
<p>These principles will be discussed in detail during the first week of class. More information can be found here: <a href="https://goo.gl/1UFRbo">https://goo.gl/1UFRbo</a>.

<h2 id="policies-and-disclaimers">Policies and disclaimers</h2>
<h3 id="attendance-and-make-up-policy">Attendance and make-up policy</h3>
<p>Students are expected to attend and actively participate in all class sessions. If you are absent from class, it is your responsibility to check on announcements made while you were away. The course attendance policy follows university’s <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf">APM 232: Policy on Student Absence</a>. Late assignments will not be accepted for a grade unless the absence meets the guidelines set forth by the university policy. Excuses and exceptions will be interpreted will also be interpreted in light of the APM 232.</p>
<h3 id="technology-issues-when-submitting-work">Technology issues when submitting work</h3>
<p>For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility to make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary, even if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your responsibility to find another way to get it to the instructor (for example, via an email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try again later or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.</p>
<h3 id="academic-dishonesty">Academic Dishonesty</h3>
<p>For most assignments you are allowed and encouraged to work with others. However, the final product that you submit for feedback must be the result of your own efforts. Therefore you may share ideas and strategies with others, but collaboration on the actual finished product you submit is not allowed. Your work is expected to be the product of your own thinking, written and explained in your own words with no parts of the work copied from external sources such as books or websites, and done clearly enough in your own mind that you could explain the work from start to finish if asked. Specifically, this excludes:</p>
<ul>
<li>copying work from another student;</li>
<li>copying work from a website;</li>
<li>copying work generated by an AI bot such as ChatGPT;</li>
<li>paraphrasing work done by another student or from print or Internet resources---i.e.,  putting it in your own words---without coming up with the main ideas and strategies yourself; and</li>
<li><em>allowing or enabling</em> another student to copy or paraphrase work that you did, even if you did the original work yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Violation of this policy is considered “academic dishonesty” and carries with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State, including possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the university. For details, please see APM 235 by going to <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf">http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dropping-the-course-after-the-census-date">Dropping the course after the census date</h3>
<p>A <em>serious and compelling reason</em> is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.</p>
<p>Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable &quot;serious and compelling reason&quot; within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.</p>
<h3 id="plagiarism-detection">Plagiarism detection</h3>
<p>The campus subscribes to Turnitin, a plagiarism prevention service, through Canvas. You will need to submit written assignments to Turnitin. Student work will be used for plagiarism detection and for no other purpose. The student may indicate in writing to the instructor that he/she refuses to participate in the plagiarism detection process, in which case the instructor can use other electronic means to verify the originality of their work. Turnitin Originality Reports WILL NOT be available for your viewing.</p>
<h3 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>All course materials, including but not limited to the syllabus, readings, quiz questions, exam questions, and assignments prepared by the instructor are property of the instructor and University. Students are prohibited from posting course materials online (e.g., Course Hero) and from selling course materials to or being paid for providing materials to any person or commercial firm without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. Doing so will constitute both an academic integrity violation and a copyright violation. Audio and video recordings of class lectures are prohibited unless I give you explicit permission in advance.
