<h2 id="length-of-a-lab-session-">Length of a lab session <!-- omit from toc --></h2>
<p>The CSU defines <em>one class hour</em> as 50 minutes of instruction, which is the default duration for a 1-unit lecture. Science laboratories fall under the category of <em>supervision courses</em> (<a href="https://academics.fresnostate.edu/scheduling/documents/CourseClassificationSystem%201.3.18.pdf">C16 category</a>). For laboratory sessions, 1 unit corresponds to <em>3 class hours</em>, totaling 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of instruction/supervision. This differs from the duration listed in the catalog (2 hours and 50 minutes) because it includes a 10-minute break after each 50 minutes of instruction.</p>
<p>Adhering to a fixed time frame in a lab setting is challenging because students work at their own pace, often in groups. Imposing fixed times for breaks might be impractical or unsafe. The nature of experimental work is a such that there is plenty of time when you just wait. You can take a short brake during idle time as long as it is safe to do so.</p>
<p>Thus, unless announced otherwise, we will work without a break and finish the lab session after 150 minutes of instruction/supervision, i.e., at 11:30 am for morning sections and 3:30 for afternoon sections.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-course">About the course</h2>
<p>The aim of this course is to inspire students to explore the breadth of organic chemistry, fostering an understanding of its principles and their practical application. This, in turn, equips students with a functional knowledge and genuine appreciation of organic structure and reactivity. In the second semester of the sequence, the emphasis shifts towards the pivotal role of experimentation in gaining molecular insights. This involves correlating molecular structure, reactivity, and function through the use of wet chemical methods and spectroscopy.</p>
<p>CHEM 129B is the second part of the 2-semester sequence in organic chemistry laboratory. As such it is primarily concerned with introducing intermediate level concepts and techniques used in organic chemistry. We will continue to use the techniques covered in the first semester lab and will introduce additional methods and techniques such as NMR spectroscopy, multi-step synthesis, green chemistry, and chemical literature.</p>
<h3 id="assumed-prior-knowledge-and-skills">Assumed prior knowledge and skills</h3>
<p>The formal pre-requisite to enroll in CHEM 129B is passing CHEM 129A (or equivalent) with a grade of &quot;C&quot; or better. In practice it means that students who enroll in CHEM 129B should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>communicate the structure and properties of organic molecules using common drawing and naming conventions;</li>
<li>conduct laboratory work of high quality including handling chemicals and other laboratory hazards in a safe, ethical, and socially responsible manner;</li>
<li>use basic laboratory techniques such as extraction, crystallization, filtration, distillation, column chromatography, TLC; and</li>
<li>measure melting point and acquire IR spectrum of a sample.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-learning-outcomes">Course Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep accurate, clear, concise, and complete records of their laboratory work in a notebook that would allow a trained organic chemist to reproduce the results.</li>
<li>Describe what you see (macroscopic) with chemical language (microscopic &amp; sub-microscopic).</li>
<li>Design ways you can separate a mixture into its components by manipulating physical and chemical properties.</li>
<li>Use standard laboratory equipment and instruments and evaluate the reliability and significance of laboratory data, all within professional ethical guidelines.</li>
<li>Use online databases to find relevant research articles containing information such as physical and chemical properties of organic molecules, synthetic procedures, and spectroscopic data.</li>
<li>Rationalize physical phenomena using polarity and intermolecular forces.</li>
<li>Plan a synthesis experiment by evaluating the information found in online databases and research articles.</li>
<li>Carry out an experimental procedure to synthesize, isolate, purify, and analyze the product of chemical synthesis.</li>
<li>Analyze the results of an experiment and be able to identify sources of error and suggest improvements.</li>
<li>Interpret spectroscopic data of organic compounds to confirm the structure of organic compounds.</li>
<li>Communicate the results of experiments to the instructor and peers in written form (lab report) and presentation (slide deck or poster).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="course-materials-and-technology">Course materials and technology</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Techniques Manual.</strong> <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Book:_Organic_Chemistry_Lab_Techniques_(Nichols)">LibreTexts e-book by Lisa Nichols</a> is our recommended reference for laboratory techniques. You may see another text listed for this course, authored by Pavia. We are in the process of phasing it out but if you own a copy of Pavia's textbook (5th or 6th edition), then feel free to use it in addition to the LibreTexts option.</li>
<li><strong>Organic Chemistry Textbook.</strong> &quot;Organic Chemistry: A Tenth Edition&quot; by John McMurry <a href="https://openstax.org/books/organic-chemistry/pages/dedication-and-preface">accessible online through OpenStax</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Personal protective equipment (PPE).</strong> Lab coat and approved safety goggles. Disposable nitrile gloves will be provided.</li>
<li><strong>Canvas.</strong> The central repository for all course materials and information is our <a href="https://fresnostate.instructure.com/courses/76128">Canvas site</a> which will be the main repository for assignments, grades, and links to materials/resources.</li>
<li><strong>Document scanning tool.</strong> Most documents you will turn in for feedback and grading will be submitted electronically but prepared on paper. A smartphone with a scanning app can be used to convert paper documents into PDFs. There are number of free options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that you like and learn how to use it.</li>
<li><strong>Personal computer.</strong> You will need a x86 class personal computer<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> that can run standalone desktop applications. Mobile devices can be used but they are inferior or incompatible with software we will use.</li>
<li><strong>ChemDraw.</strong> Leading app for drawing structures, reactions, diagrams, and more. The department purchased a license multi-user license. Instructions on how to obtain and activate the software will be provided by the instructor.</li>
<li><strong>MestReNova (mNova).</strong> Leading app for processing and analyzing of spectroscopic data. We will use it to convert raw data from spectrometer to professional spectra. The department purchased a multi-user license. Instructions on how to obtain and activate the license will be provided by the instructor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-workflow">Course workflow</h2>
<p>Activities in this course follows a cyclical pattern. Over the semester you will engage in 5 experimental modules and an independent research project. At the heart of each module is a synthesis of an organic compound (1–3 steps). Specific requirements will be communicated by the instructor at the beginning of the semester.</p>
<p><strong>Before class</strong>, your task will be to prepare for the experiment by studying the relevant reactions and mechanisms, lab techniques, and safety information about chemicals you will be work-ing with. Your instructor may assign graded pre-lab assignment to help you prepare for the lab.</p>
<p><strong>Class time</strong> will be focused primarily on doing experiments, making observations, generating results, processing spectroscopic data, and group discussions. Results and observations made during lab are important inputs for writing post-lab reports. For example, not making a key observation or obtaining poor quality data may reduce your grade on the experiment because you will not have all information to write the lab report or discuss the results.</p>
<p><strong>After class</strong> you will work on finalizing the documentation related to the experiment, usually in a form of typed lab report. Details for each post-lab assignment will be posted on Can-vas by the instructor. Document templates will be available for formal lab reports.</p>
<h2 id="on-keeping-records-lab-notebook">On keeping records (lab notebook)</h2>
<p>The human brain is both the least reliable whiteboard and the least dependable alarm clock. It's crucial to acknowledge that memories of your actions and observations in the lab can fade rapidly once you step away. To counteract this, it's essential to document your experiences in real time, as these notes (combined with pre-lab documentation) will serve as the foundation for your subsequent post-lab tasks, such as reports and presentations.</p>
<p>Maintain a comprehensive record of what you did and observed. Also keep all physical copies such as IR and NMR spectra, gas chromatograms, and sketches of TLC plates. These components contribute to your experimental record. Remember that your lab notes are subject to evaluation at any point and should remain up-to-date. Your instructor will provide guidelines on how to maintain your laboratory notebook at the start of the semester. Be prepared to submit your in-lab notes for assessment before concluding your time in the lab. your time in the lab.</p>
<h3 id="lab-notes-guiding-principles">Lab notes guiding principles</h3>
<p>Lab notes should document what you did and how, what you observed, and the data you collected. To know what to write and not to write in the notebook is a balancing act of relevance and brevity. You need write down details that are relevant and necessary for someone to reproduce your work. This hypothetical chemist will not be able to consult with you or have access to any auxiliary documentation that you had access to while doing the experiment. Therefore, you need to describe what you did and how.</p>
<p>It is safe to assume, however, that the reader of your notes has been trained in the basic organic laboratory techniques. For example, you don’t have to explain how to do a recrystallization because the reader who will should know how to carry out recrystallization (and if not, they can refer to a techniques manual). What will be helpful to them are the details relevant to this particular recrystallization: solvent used, approximate volume of solvent, time it took to cool and grow crystals.</p>
<p>Lab notes should be easy to read—use paragraph breaks, headings, etc. to help the reader navigate the notebook.</p>
<p>Contrary to common belief, reproducible and detailed lab notes don’t have to be long and take a lot of time and effort to produce. Below is an example statement that captures all important information about purification of the crude material, yield, and the appearance of the final product:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The crude product (sticky brown solid, 1.23 g) was recrystallized from hot ethanol (15 mL) in an Erlenmeyer flask. After cooling to rt and then to 0 °C, the solid was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with ice-cold water, and dried in air for 1 h to give the product as a white crystalline solid (0.38 g), mp 87–89 °C.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additional benefit of writing it all down in real time is that it can help you track down errors, explain unexpected outcomes, and/or troubleshoot the experiment that went wrong. In the recrystallization described above, the mass recovery is quite poor and a chemist repeating the experiment may decide to use less ethanol (or a different solvent) to improve the mass recovery.</p>
<h2 id="assessments-and-grading">Assessments and grading</h2>
<p>The final grade in the course will be based on your work in three areas (see table below). There will be four experiment sets, independent project, and quizzes. Each experiment set will have variety of graded work (pre-lab, lab notebook, report, and other assignments) that add contributes to the 15% value for each lab set.</p>

Grading in this course is different than you might be used to. Please read this section carefully and ask questions as needed.
:::</p>
<p>As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that <em>learning takes time</em> and that grading your work based on a single point of data, such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps unethical. A truly valid measure of learning has to involve <em>multiple attempts</em> that allow you to learn from your past mistakes and demonstrate not only your skill, but also your growth. I believe your work should be evaluated by just like everyone else's work in the real world is evaluated, i.e., by giving you <em>clearly defined standards</em> for quality, <em>detailed verbal feedback</em> on your work, and <em>opportunities to try again</em> based on the feedback. This gets you into a <em>feedback loop</em>, a conversation between you and me about your work, that continues until your work meets the standards (or we reach the end of the semester). In light of the principles outlined above, in this course students can <em>revise and resubmit some of their work</em>, several times over if needed, using the feedback at each stage to improve and grow.</p>
<h3 id="grading-of-experiments">Grading of experiments</h3>
<p>You will receive feedback and marks on work that you produce in- and outside the lab. Those include pre-lab documentation, experimental notes and observations, results (yield, spectroscopic data), and written lab report. Each of the regular experiments contributes 15% to the final grade and will have several components (see table below for details).</p>

<h3 id="research-project">Research project</h3>
<p>During the second half of the semester, students will engage in an independent research project known as a CURE (Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience). The instructor will not provide the project's objective and methods, and the outcomes are either entirely unknown or only partially revealed. To accomplish the project, students will conduct comprehensive literature research to gather the essential information required for the synthesis. The culmination of this endeavor will involve delivering a presentation to the class.</p>

<h2 id="safe-chemical-laboratory-practices">Safe Chemical Laboratory Practices</h2>
<ol>
<li>NO food or drink in the laboratory.</li>
<li>Wear clothing appropriate for laboratory work.</li>
<li>Select and correctly use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).</li>
<li>Know what to do and who to contact in an emergency in the laboratory.</li>
<li>Avoid distractions and be alert to and aware of your surroundings and potential hazards in your area.</li>
<li>Maintain a safe and clean work area.</li>
<li>Only conduct experiments or procedures approved by your lab instructor or research advisor.</li>
<li>Understand the common chemical hazards and hazards specific to the chemicals and procedures with which you are working.</li>
<li>Understand and follow best practices on how to handle, transport, store, and dispose of chemicals safely.</li>
<li>If any equipment, glassware, or procedures are not working properly or as expected, notify your instructor before proceeding.</li>
<li>Notify your instructor if you have, develop, or may develop any medical conditions (e.g. severe asthma, limited mobility, vision impairment, pregnancy, etc) that may affect your safety in the laboratory or sensitivity to chemicals, so that your instructor can properly advise or accommodate you on minimizing the risks associated with laboratory work.</li>
</ol>
<p>These principles will be discussed in detail during the first week of class. More information can be found here: <a href="https://goo.gl/1UFRbo">https://goo.gl/1UFRbo</a>. Also, refer to <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/about/governance/committees/chemicalsafety/publications/acs-safety-guidelines-academic.pdf"><em>Guidelines for Chemical Laboratory Safety in Academic Institutions</em></a> published by American Chemical Society.</p>
<h2 id="policies-and-disclaimers">Policies and disclaimers</h2>
<h3 id="instructor-availability-and-message-responses">Instructor availability and message responses</h3>
<p><strong>You can ask a question about anything at any time.</strong> You have both the right and the responsibility to ask questions about anything in the course you don't fully understand, whether math or some aspect of the syllabus or anything else. You can use email, office hours, appointments, or grab me before or after class.</p>
<p>However, please note that I cannot always respond immediately to messages. In particular <strong>I do not typically check email between 6:00pm and 8:00am on weeknights</strong>, and <strong>I do not typically check email at all on weekends</strong> in order to prioritize time for family and other non-work pursuits. That said,</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages sent on a weekday (Monday-Friday) before 3:00 pm will likely get a response <em>the same day</em>.</li>
<li>Messages sent after 3:00 pm Monday-Thursday will get a response <em>the next day</em>.</li>
<li>Messages sent after 3:00 pm on Fridays or on the weekend will get a response <em>the following Monday</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please plan ahead for instructor availability.</strong> For example if you have something to turn in on a Friday, and you send a question by email after 3:00pm, my reply may not come in time to help you; plan ahead for contingencies like this.</p>
<h3 id="attendance-and-make-up-policy">Attendance and make-up policy</h3>
<p>Students are expected to attend and actively participate in all class sessions. If you are absent from class, it is your responsibility to check on announcements made while you were away. The course attendance policy follows university’s <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf">APM 232: Policy on Student Absence</a>. Late assignments will not be accepted for a grade unless the absence meets the guidelines set forth by the university policy. Excuses and exceptions will be interpreted will in light of the APM 232.</p>
<h3 id="technology-issues-when-submitting-work">Technology issues when submitting work</h3>
<p>For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility to make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary, even if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your responsibility to find another way to get it to the instructor (for example, via an email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try again later or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h3>
<p>This course  is subject to <a href="https://studentaffairs.fresnostate.edu/studentconduct/academic-integrity/">Standards of Student Conduct</a>, <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/236.pdf">The Code of Academic Integrity</a>, and <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf">APM 235: Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism</a>. Every student has the responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest activities.</p>
<p>None of these policies should be necessary because there's no need to be academically dishonest thanks to the revision/resubmission policy. Rather than engage in academic dishonesty and putting your entire career at risk, just turn in your best complete good-faith effort on assignments. And then, if revisions are needed, you'll typically get the chance.</p>

Anything else is subject to strong penalties that are required by the university.</p>
</div>
<p>Any action or behavior that misrepresents one’s contributions to or the results of any scholarly product submitted for credit, evaluation, or dissemination will be considered academic misconduct. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cheating</em>: Attempting to use materials, information, or aids that have not been authorized by the instructor for academic work.</li>
<li><em>Collusion</em>: Unauthorized collaboration with another person in preparing academic assignments offered for credit, and collaboration with another person to commit a violation of any section of the rules on academic misconduct. Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are included in the definition of &quot;another person&quot;.</li>
<li><em>Dual submission</em>: Submitting work that has been previously graded, or is being submitted concurrently to more than one course, without authorization from the instructor of the class to which the student wishes to submit. (This especially applies to those who are repeating CHEM 129B.)</li>
<li><em>Plagiarism</em>: Appropriation of, buying, receiving as a gift, or obtaining by any means material that is attributable in whole or in part to another source without any indication or citation of the original source, including words, sentences, ideas, illustrations, structure, computer code, and other expression or media, and presenting that material as one’s own academic work being offered for credit or in conjunction with a program, course, or degree requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that this is not a complete list; and note that <strong>enabling others</strong> to engage in academic misconduct may be considered as a form of academic misconduct.</p>
<h3 id="dropping-the-course-after-the-census-date">Dropping the course after the census date</h3>
<p>A <em>serious and compelling reason</em> is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.</p>
<p>Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable &quot;serious and compelling reason&quot; within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.</p>
<h3 id="plagiarism-detection">Plagiarism detection</h3>
<p>The campus subscribes to Turnitin, a plagiarism prevention service, through Canvas. You will need to submit written assignments to Turnitin. Student work will be used for plagiarism detection and for no other purpose. The student may indicate in writing to the instructor that he/she refuses to participate in the plagiarism detection process, in which case the instructor can use other electronic means to verify the originality of their work. Turnitin Originality Reports WILL NOT be available for your viewing.</p>
<h3 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>All course materials, including but not limited to the syllabus, readings, quiz questions, exam questions, and assignments prepared by the instructor are property of the instructor and University. Students are prohibited from posting course materials online (e.g., Course Hero) and from selling course materials to or being paid for providing materials to any person or commercial firm without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. Doing so will constitute both an academic integrity violation and a copyright violation. Audio and video recordings of class lectures are prohibited unless I give you explicit permission in advance. Students with an official letter from the Services for Students with Disabilities office may record the class if SSD has approved that service. Otherwise, recordings of lectures are included in the intellectual property notice described above.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-resolution">Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>If there are questions or concerns that you have about this course that you and I are not able to resolve, please feel free to contact the Chair of the department to discuss the matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chair's name: Dr. Krish Krishnan</li>
<li>Department name: Chemistry and Biochemistry</li>
<li>Chair's email: <a href="mailto:krish@csufresno.edu">krish@csufresno.edu</a></li>
<li>Department phone number:</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="student-ratings-of-instruction">Student Ratings of Instruction</h3>
<p>In the final weeks of the semester, you will be asked to complete a short survey to provide feedback about this class. The primary goal of student ratings is to help your instructor improve the class. Feedback will also be reviewed by the department chair and the college dean. You will be given 15 minutes of class time to complete student ratings. Please offer feedback honestly and thoughtfully. Your participation is appreciated. You can access your student rating surveys and get more information at: <a href="https://sites.google.com/mail.fresnostate.edu/fresno-state-sri/fssri-for-students">https://sites.google.com/mail.fresnostate.edu/fresno-state-sri/fssri-for-students</a>.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-a-rubrics">Appendix A: Rubrics</h2>
<h3 id="lab-readiness">Lab readiness</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Satisfactory (2)</strong>: Prelab documentation (stoichiometry table, calculations, etc) is complete, accurate and conveys student’s readiness to carry out the experiment.</li>
<li><strong>Progressing (1</strong>): Prelab documentation (stoichiometry table, calculations, etc) is complete but contains errors or inaccuracies. The errors don’t compromise student’s readiness to carry out the experiment.</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete (0</strong>): Prelab documentation was not submitted OR the submitted material is incomplete, contains critical errors or significant inaccuracies that compromise student’s readiness for the experiment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="risk-assessment-rubric">Risk assessment rubric</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete (2)</strong>: Hazard and risk assessment is complete, accurate, and relevant to the experiment. Significant risks and hazards are identified and a safety recommendation is provided. Errors are insignificant or inconsequential</li>
<li><strong>Progressing (1)</strong>: Hazard and risk assessment is provided but significant gaps remain, the safety information is inaccurate or not irrelevant to the experiment.</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete (0)</strong>: Safety information is not provided OR the information provided significantly increases the risk of exposure to hazards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lab-notebook-rubric">Lab notebook rubric</h3>
<p>The notes will allow others to reproduce the work. The notes include observations and communicate what was done, how, when, and by whom.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully reproducible (3)</strong>: The notes are complete and include all key information. A person unfamiliar with the experiment is highly likely to obtain similar results. Errors are insignificant or inconsequential.</li>
<li><strong>Somewhat reproducible (2)</strong>: The notes include most of the experimental details needed to repeat the experiment. A person unfamiliar with the experiment is somewhat likely to obtain similar results.</li>
<li><strong>Reproducibility compromised (1)</strong>: The notes don't include necessary information needed to repeat the experiment. Significant omissions and errors are present. Even a person familiar with the experiment is unlikely to obtain similar results.</li>
<li><strong>Not reproducible (0)</strong>: The copy of lab notes was not submitted, the notes are incomplete or not helpful. A person unfamiliar with the experiment is very unlikely to obtain similar results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="experimental-results-rubric">Experimental results rubric</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reasonable (3)</strong>: Product obtained with reasonable yield and purity.</li>
<li><strong>Somewhat reproducible (2)</strong>: Product obtained but either yield or purity are compromised.</li>
<li><strong>Reproducibility compromised (1)</strong>: Product obtained but both yield and purity are severely compromised.</li>
<li><strong>Not reproducible (0)</strong>: No product was obtained.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="grading-of-lab-reports-and-the-emrn-rubric">Grading of lab reports and the EMRN rubric</h3>
<p>One of the main objectives of this course is for you to learn to interpret and communicate experimental results. This is a difficult skill that needs to be developed over time through iteration and feedback loops. At the end of each module you will submit a formal lab report, short version for the first two modules, and more extensive for modules 3-5. Each experiment will end with submission of a written lab report which will be evaluated using &quot;EMRN&quot; rubric shown below.</p>
<p><img src="file:////Users/hmuchalski-local/GitHub/128a/syllabus-CHEM-129B/EMRN-rubric-2020.png" alt="EMRN rubric"></p>
<p>Each lab report can be revised and resubmitted before the grade becomes final. Deadlines and conditions for submission of revised reports will be communicated in Canvas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grade &quot;E&quot; or &quot;M&quot; receives full score (5%)</li>
<li>Grade &quot;R&quot; will receive partial score (3%) with an option to revise and resubmit.</li>
<li>Grade &quot;N&quot; will receive partial score (2%) with an option to revise and resubmit but the feedback will be very limited.</li>
<li>No report will not receive credit (0%). Submissions after the deadline will be reviewed as-is with no possibility for revision and resubmission.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="research-report-and-presentation">Research report and presentation</h3>
<p>Written reports and oral presentations will be evaluated using the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZAL5_sTpci3waFMQVWRrhFqTF9uOIwv9/view?usp=sharing">ELIPSS rubric</a>. Enhancing Learning by Improving Process Skills in STEM (ELIPSS) is an NSF-funded project that focuses on the identification, development, and assessment of process skills (also known as professional skills, practical skills, workplace skills, transferable skills, or soft skills) in active learning, undergraduate STEM classrooms. Assessing process skill development and providing feedback to students and instructors is a key component for enhancing these skills in STEM programs.</p>
