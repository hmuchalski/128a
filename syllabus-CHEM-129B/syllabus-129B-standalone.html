<h2 id="course-learning-outcomes">Course Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>This course is organized into Modules and aims to help students achieve learning outcomes through online activities. Each module contains materials you need to complete the associated activities. Each course-level student learning outcome is aligned with department-level learning outcomes which are modeled after the standards set by the American Chemical Society.</p>
<p>Upon completion of this course students will be able to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Communicate the structure and properties of organic molecules using common drawing and naming conventions</li>
<li>Analyze chemical structures and reaction conditions to make and defend predictions about chemical transformations</li>
<li>Use online databases to find relevant research articles containing information such as physicochemical properties of organic molecules, synthetic procedures, and spectroscopic data.</li>
<li>Use software tools such as ChemDraw to draw chemical structures, reactions, and mechanisms</li>
<li>Use software tools such as MestReNova and Topspin to process raw NMR data</li>
<li>Plan a synthesis experiment by evaluating the information found in online databases and research articles <!-- 7. Carry out an experimental procedure to synthesize, isolate, purify, and analyze the product of a chemical reaction (face-to-face course only) --></li>
<li>Analyze the results of an experiment and be able to identify sources of error and suggest improvements;</li>
<li>Interpret spectroscopic data of organic compounds to confirm the structure of organic compounds</li>
<li>Communicate the results of experiments to the instructor and peers in a written form (lab report)</li>
<li>Communicate the results of experiments to the instructor and peers in an oral or poster presentation</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="department-student-learning-outcomes">Department Student Learning Outcomes</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Students will apply their understanding of terminology, concepts, theories, and skills to solve problems by defining problems and research questions clearly, formulating testable hypotheses, designing and conducting experimental tests of hypotheses, analyzing and interpreting data, and drawing appropriate conclusions within professional ethical guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.1 &amp; 7.6)</li>
<li>Students will demonstrate the ability to conduct laboratory work of high quality including handling chemicals and other laboratory hazards in a safe, ethical, and socially responsible manner, keeping accurate, clear, concise, and complete records of their laboratory work in a notebook, properly using standard laboratory equipment and instruments, and evaluating the reliability and significance of laboratory data, all within professional ethical guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.1, 7.3, 7.6)</li>
<li>Students will complete a literature search in one or more of the five chemical sub disciplines by using common literature search techniques and tools to find recent journal articles from the peer-reviewed literature, critically read these articles to extract relevant information, and communicate the significance of these articles in written or oral formats within professional ethical guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.2 &amp; 7.6)</li>
<li>Students will demonstrate the ability to clearly and effectively communicate their scientific results and opinions using written formats while following professional style and format conventions within professional ethical guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.4 &amp; 7.6)</li>
<li>Students will demonstrate the ability to clearly and effectively communicate their scientific results and opinions using oral formats while following professional style and format conventions within professional ethical guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.4 &amp; 7.6)</li>
<li>Students will demonstrate the ability to function effectively in collaborative and group work environments including the ability to work on a component of a larger project and connect work with previous results within professional ethical standards. (ACS Standard 7.5 &amp; 7.6)</li>

<p>Grade brackets are imposed by course coordinator. In the past, the grading scale followed a pattern close to the following: A = 90–100, B 80–89, C 70–79; D 60–69; and F &lt;60.</p>
<h1 id="course-policies">Course policies</h1>
<h2 id="technology-issues-when-submitting-work">Technology issues when submitting work</h2>
<p>For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility to make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary, even if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your responsibility to find another way to get it to me (for example, via an email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try again later, use a different browser, or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.</p>
<h2 id="academic-dishonesty">Academic Dishonesty</h2>
<p>For most assignments you are allowed and encouraged to work with others. However, the final product that you submit for feedback must be the result of your own efforts. Therefore you may share ideas and strategies with others, but collaboration on the actual finished product you submit is not allowed. Your work is expected to be the product of your own thinking, written and explained in your own words with no parts of the work copied from external sources such as books or websites, and done clearly enough in your own mind that you could explain the work from start to finish if asked. Specifically, this excludes:</p>
<ul>
<li>copying work from another student;</li>
<li>copying work from a website;</li>
<li>paraphrasing work done by another student or from print or internet resources—i.e. putting it in your own words—without coming up with the main ideas and strategies yourself; and</li>
<li><em>allowing or enabling</em> another student to copy or paraphrase work that you did, even if you did the original work yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Violation of this policy is considered “academic dishonesty” and carries with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State, including possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the university. For details, please see APM 235 by going to <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf">http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>You may feel tempted to academic dishonesty at some point in the semester. The work can be difficult, and many of you are under a lot of stress. If you are considering academic dishonesty, please STOP, take a breath, and remember that your classmates and I want you to succeed in the course. You are not alone, and you have a strong network in the class for getting help. The revision and resubmission policies mean that it’s OK to turn in work that isn’t perfect. There is no need to be academically dishonest! Just do your best on the work, and you’ll have the chance to revise it later.</p>
<h2 id="dropping-the-course-after-the-census-date">Dropping the course after the census date</h2>
<p>A <em>serious and compelling reason</em> is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student’s ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.</p>
<p>Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable “serious and compelling reason” within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.</p>
<h1 id="university-policies-and-disclaimers">University policies and disclaimers</h1>
<p>In addition to course policies, you are expected to be familiar with Academic Regulations described in the <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/catalog/academic-regulations/">University Catalog</a> as well as policies listed below.</p>
