<h2 id="note-about-the-duration-of-a-lab-session">Note about the
duration of a lab session <!-- omit from toc --></h2>
<p>The CSU defines <em>one class hour</em> as 50 minutes of instruction,
which is the default duration for a 1-unit lecture. Science laboratories
fall under the category of <em>supervision courses</em> (<a
href="https://academics.fresnostate.edu/scheduling/documents/CourseClassificationSystem%201.3.18.pdf">C16
category</a>). For laboratory sessions, 1 unit corresponds to <em>3
class hours</em>, totaling 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of
instruction/supervision. This differs from the duration listed in the
catalog (2 hours and 50 minutes) because it assumes a 10-minute break
after each 50 minutes of instruction. However, adhering to a fixed time
frame in a lab setting is challenging because students work at their own
pace, often in groups. Having fixed times for breaks might be
impractical or unsafe. Consequently, on days when we work without a
break, we will finish the lab session after 150 minutes of
instruction/supervision, 11:30 am for AM sections and 3:30 for PM
sections.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-course">About the course</h2>
<p>The aim of this course is to inspire students to explore the breadth
of organic chemistry, fostering an understanding of its principles and
their practical application. This, in turn, equips students with a
functional knowledge and genuine appreciation of organic structure and
reactivity. In the second semester of the sequence, the emphasis shifts
towards the pivotal role of experimentation in gaining molecular
insights. This involves correlating molecular structure, reactivity, and
function through the use of wet chemical methods and spectroscopy.</p>
<p>CHEM 129B is the second part of the 2-semester sequence in organic
chemistry laboratory. As such it is primarily concerned with introducing
intermediate level concepts and techniques used in organic chemistry. We
will continue to use the techniques covered in the first semester lab
and will introduce additional methods and techniques such as NMR
spectroscopy, multi-step synthesis, green chemistry, and chemical
literature.</p>
<h3 id="assumed-prior-knowledge-and-skills">Assumed prior knowledge and
skills</h3>
<p>The formal pre-requisite to enroll in CHEM 129B is passing CHEM 129A
(or equivalent) with a grade of “C” or better. In practice it means that
students who enroll in CHEM 129B should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>communicate the structure and properties of organic molecules using
common drawing and naming conventions;</li>
<li>conduct laboratory work of high quality including handling chemicals
and other laboratory hazards in a safe, ethical, and socially
responsible manner;</li>
<li>use basic laboratory techniques such as extraction, crystallization,
filtration, distillation, column chromatography, TLC; and</li>
<li>measure melting point and acquire IR spectrum of a sample.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-learning-outcomes">Course Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep accurate, clear, concise, and complete records of their
laboratory work in a notebook that would allow a trained organic chemist
to reproduce the results.</li>
<li>Describe what you see (macroscopic) with chemical language
(microscopic &amp; sub-microscopic).</li>
<li>Design ways you can separate a mixture into its components by
manipulating physical and chemical properties.</li>
<li>Use standard laboratory equipment and instruments and evaluate the
reliability and significance of laboratory data, all within professional
ethical guidelines.</li>
<li>Use online databases to find relevant research articles containing
information such as physical and chemical properties of organic
molecules, synthetic procedures, and spectroscopic data.</li>
<li>Rationalize physical phenomena using polarity and intermolecular
forces.</li>
<li>Plan a synthesis experiment by evaluating the information found in
online databases and research articles.</li>
<li>Carry out an experimental procedure to synthesize, isolate, purify,
and analyze the product of chemical synthesis.</li>
<li>Analyze the results of an experiment and be able to identify sources
of error and suggest improvements.</li>
<li>Interpret spectroscopic data of organic compounds to confirm the
structure of organic compounds.</li>
<li>Communicate the results of experiments to the instructor and peers
in written form (lab report) and presentation (slide deck or
poster).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Techniques Reference Manual</strong> <a
href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Book:_Organic_Chemistry_Lab_Techniques_(Nichols)">LibreTexts
e-book by Lisa Nichols</a> is our recommended reference for laboratory
techniques. The textbook by Pavia et al. is listed as the official
textbook for this course, but we are in the process of phasing it out.
If you own a copy of Pavia’s textbook (5th or 6th edition), then feel
free to use it in addition to the LibreTexts option</li>
<li><strong>Personal protective equipment (PPE)</strong>: Lab coat and
approved safety goggles. Disposable nitrile gloves will be
provided.</li>
<li><strong>Canvas:</strong> The central repository for all course
materials and information is our <a
href="https://fresnostate.instructure.com/courses/76128">Canvas site</a>
which will be the main repository for assignments, grades, and links to
materials/resources.</li>
<li><strong>Document scanning tool</strong>: Most documents you will
turn in for feedback and grading will be submitted electronically but
prepared on paper. A smartphone with a scanning app can be used to
convert paper documents into PDFs. There are number of free options
available for both iOS and Android. Find one that you like and learn how
to use it.</li>
<li><strong>Personal computer:</strong> You will need a x86 class
personal computer<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that can run standalone desktop
applications. Mobile devices can be used but they are inferior or
incompatible with software we will use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-workflow">Course workflow</h2>
<p>Activities in this course follows a cyclical pattern. Over the
semester you will engage in 5 experimental modules and an independent
research project. At the heart of each module is a synthesis of an
organic compound (1–3 steps). Specific requirements will be communicated
by the instructor at the beginning of the semester.</p>
<p><strong>Before class</strong>, your task will be to prepare for the
experiment by studying the relevant reactions and mechanisms, lab
techniques, and safety information about chemicals you will be work-ing
with. Your instructor may assign graded pre-lab assignment to help you
prepare for the lab.</p>
<p><strong>Class time</strong> will be focused primarily on doing
experiments, making observations, generating results, processing
spectroscopic data, and group discussions. Results and observations made
during lab are important inputs for writing post-lab reports. For
example, not making a key observation or obtaining poor quality data may
reduce your grade on the experiment because you will not have all
information to write the lab report or discuss the results.</p>
<p><strong>After class</strong> you will work on finalizing the
documentation related to the experiment, usually in a form of typed lab
report. Details for each post-lab assignment will be posted on Can-vas
by the instructor. Document templates will be available for formal lab
reports.</p>
<h2 id="on-keeping-records-lab-notebook">On keeping records (lab
notebook)</h2>
<p>The human brain is both the least reliable whiteboard and the least
dependable alarm clock. It’s crucial to acknowledge that memories of
your actions and observations in the lab can fade rapidly once you step
away. To counteract this, it’s essential to document your experiences in
real time, as these notes (combined with pre-lab documentation) will
serve as the foundation for your subsequent post-lab tasks, such as
reports and presentations.</p>
<p>Maintain a comprehensive record of what you did and observed. Also
keep all physical copies such as IR and NMR spectra, gas chromatograms,
and sketches of TLC plates. These components contribute to your
experimental record. Remember that your lab notes are subject to
evaluation at any point and should remain up-to-date. Your instructor
will provide guidelines on how to maintain your laboratory notebook at
the start of the semester. Be prepared to submit your in-lab notes for
assessment before concluding your time in the lab. your time in the
lab.</p>
<h3 id="lab-notes-guiding-principles">Lab notes guiding principles</h3>
<p>Lab notes should document what you did and how, what you observed,
and the data you collected. To know what to write and not to write in
the notebook is a balancing act of relevance and brevity. You need write
down details that are relevant and necessary for someone to reproduce
your work. This hypothetical chemist will not be able to consult with
you or have access to any auxiliary documentation that you had access to
while doing the experiment. Therefore, you need to describe what you did
and how.</p>
<p>It is safe to assume, however, that the reader of your notes has been
trained in the basic organic laboratory techniques. For example, you
don’t have to explain how to do a recrystallization because the reader
who will should know how to carry out recrystallization (and if not,
they can refer to a techniques manual). What will be helpful to them are
the details relevant to this particular recrystallization: solvent used,
approximate volume of solvent, time it took to cool and grow
crystals.</p>
<p>Lab notes should be easy to read—use paragraph breaks, headings, etc.
to help the reader navigate the notebook.</p>
<p>Contrary to common belief, reproducible and detailed lab notes don’t
have to be long and take a lot of time and effort to produce. Below is
an example statement that captures all important information about
purification of the crude material, yield, and the appearance of the
final product:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The crude product (sticky brown solid, 1.23 g) was recrystallized
from hot ethanol (15 mL) in an Erlenmeyer flask. After cooling to rt and
then to 0 °C, the solid was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with
ice-cold water, and dried in air for 1 h to give the product as a white
crystalline solid (0.38 g), mp 87–89 °C.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additional benefit of writing it all down in real time is that it can
help you track down errors, explain unexpected outcomes, and/or
troubleshoot the experiment that went wrong. In the recrystallization
described above, the mass recovery is quite poor and a chemist repeating
the experiment may decide to use less ethanol (or a different solvent)
to improve the mass recovery.</p>
<h2 id="assessments-and-grading">Assessments and grading</h2>
<p>The final grade in the course will be based on your work in three
areas (see table below). There will be four experiment sets, independent
project, and quizzes. Each experiment set will have variety of graded
work (pre-lab, lab notebook, report, and other assignments) that add
contributes to the 15% value for each lab set.</p>

<h3 id="grading-philosophy">Grading philosophy</h3>
<div class="warning">
<p>Grading in this course is different than you might be used to. Please
read this section carefully and ask questions as needed.</p>
</div>
<p>As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that <em>learning takes
time</em> and that grading your work based on a single point of data,
such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps
unethical. A truly valid measure of learning has to involve <em>multiple
attempts</em> that allow you to learn from your past mistakes and
demonstrate not only your skill, but also your growth. I believe your
work should be evaluated by just like everyone else’s work in the real
world is evaluated, i.e., by giving you <em>clearly defined
standards</em> for quality, <em>detailed verbal feedback</em> on your
work, and <em>opportunities to try again</em> based on the feedback.
This gets you into a <em>feedback loop</em>, a conversation between you
and me about your work, that continues until your work meets the
standards (or we reach the end of the semester). In light of the
principles outlined above, in this course students can <em>revise and
resubmit some of their work</em>, several times over if needed, using
the feedback at each stage to improve and grow.</p>
<h3 id="grading-of-experiments">Grading of experiments</h3>
<p>You will receive feedback and marks on work that you produce in- and
outside the lab. Those include pre-lab documentation, experimental notes
and observations, results (yield, spectroscopic data), and written lab
report. Each of the regular experiments contributes 15% to the final
grade and will have several components (see table below for
details).</p>

on weeknights, and I typically do not check email at all on weekends.
That said,</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages sent on a weekday (Monday–Friday) before 4:00 pm will get a

<h3 id="attendance-and-make-up-policy">Attendance and make-up
policy</h3>
<p>Students are expected to attend and actively participate in all class
sessions. If you are absent from class, it is your responsibility to
check on announcements made while you were away. The course attendance
policy follows university’s <a
href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf">APM
232: Policy on Student Absence</a>. Late assignments will not be
accepted for a grade unless the absence meets the guidelines set forth
by the university policy. Excuses and exceptions will be interpreted
will in light of the APM 232.</p>
<h3 id="technology-issues-when-submitting-work">Technology issues when
submitting work</h3>
<p>For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility
to make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary,
even if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your
responsibility to find another way to get it to the instructor (for
example, via an email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable
or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid
grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to
upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try
again later or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload
it successfully.</p>
<h3 id="academic-dishonesty">Academic Dishonesty</h3>
<p>For most assignments you are allowed and encouraged to work with
others. However, the final product that you submit for feedback must be
the result of your own efforts. Therefore you may share ideas and
strategies with others, but collaboration on the actual finished product
you submit is not allowed. Your work is expected to be the product of
your own thinking, written and explained in your own words with no parts
of the work copied from external sources such as books or websites, and
done clearly enough in your own mind that you could explain the work
from start to finish if asked. Specifically, this excludes:</p>
<ul>
<li>copying work from another student;</li>
<li>copying work from a website;</li>
<li>copying work generated by an AI bot such as ChatGPT;</li>
<li>paraphrasing work done by another student or from print or Internet
resources—i.e.,putting it in your own words—without coming up with the
main ideas and strategies yourself; and</li>
<li><em>allowing or enabling</em> another student to copy or paraphrase
work that you did, even if you did the original work yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Violation of this policy is considered “academic dishonesty” and
carries with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State,
including possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from
the university. For details, please see APM 235 by going to <a

<p>A <em>serious and compelling reason</em> is defined as an unexpected
condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that
unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student’s ability to attend
class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be
acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the
department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the
appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that
substantiates the condition.</p>
<p>Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable “serious
and compelling reason” within the University policy, nor is
dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.</p>
<h3 id="plagiarism-detection">Plagiarism detection</h3>
<p>The campus subscribes to Turnitin, a plagiarism prevention service,
through Canvas. You will need to submit written assignments to Turnitin.
Student work will be used for plagiarism detection and for no other
purpose. The student may indicate in writing to the instructor that
he/she refuses to participate in the plagiarism detection process, in
which case the instructor can use other electronic means to verify the
originality of their work. Turnitin Originality Reports WILL NOT be
available for your viewing.</p>
<h3 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>All course materials, including but not limited to the syllabus,
readings, quiz questions, exam questions, and assignments prepared by
the instructor are property of the instructor and University. Students
are prohibited from posting course materials online (e.g., Course Hero)
and from selling course materials to or being paid for providing
materials to any person or commercial firm without the express written
permission of the professor teaching this course. Doing so will
constitute both an academic integrity violation and a copyright
violation. Audio and video recordings of class lectures are prohibited
unless I give you explicit permission in advance. Students with an
official letter from the Services for Students with Disabilities office
may record the class if SSD has approved that service. Otherwise,
recordings of lectures are included in the intellectual property notice
described above.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-resolution">Dispute Resolution</h3>

<h2 id="appendix-a-rubrics">Appendix A: Rubrics</h2>
<h3 id="lab-readiness">Lab readiness</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Satisfactory (2)</strong>: Prelab documentation
(stoichiometry table, calculations, etc) is complete, accurate and
conveys student’s readiness to carry out the experiment.</li>
<li><strong>Progressing (1</strong>): Prelab documentation
(stoichiometry table, calculations, etc) is complete but contains errors
or inaccuracies. The errors don’t compromise student’s readiness to
carry out the experiment.</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete (0</strong>): Prelab documentation was not
submitted OR the submitted material is incomplete, contains critical
errors or significant inaccuracies that compromise student’s readiness
for the experiment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="risk-assessment-rubric">Risk assessment rubric</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete (2)</strong>: Hazard and risk assessment is
complete, accurate, and relevant to the experiment. Significant risks
and hazards are identified and a safety recommendation is provided.
Errors are insignificant or inconsequential</li>
<li><strong>Progressing (1)</strong>: Hazard and risk assessment is
provided but significant gaps remain, the safety information is
inaccurate or not irrelevant to the experiment.</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete (0)</strong>: Safety information is not provided
OR the information provided significantly increases the risk of exposure
to hazards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lab-notebook-rubric">Lab notebook rubric</h3>
<p>The notes will allow others to reproduce the work. The notes include
observations and communicate what was done, how, when, and by whom.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully reproducible (3)</strong>: The notes are complete and
include all key information. A person unfamiliar with the experiment is
highly likely to obtain similar results. Errors are insignificant or
inconsequential.</li>
<li><strong>Somewhat reproducible (2)</strong>: The notes include most
of the experimental details needed to repeat the experiment. A person
unfamiliar with the experiment is somewhat likely to obtain similar
results.</li>
<li><strong>Reproducibility compromised (1)</strong>: The notes don’t
include necessary information needed to repeat the experiment.
Significant omissions and errors are present. Even a person familiar
with the experiment is unlikely to obtain similar results.</li>
<li><strong>Not reproducible (0)</strong>: The copy of lab notes was not
submitted, the notes are incomplete or not helpful. A person unfamiliar
with the experiment is very unlikely to obtain similar results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="experimental-results-rubric">Experimental results rubric</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reasonable (3)</strong>: Product obtained with reasonable
yield and purity.</li>
<li><strong>Somewhat reproducible (2)</strong>: Product obtained but
either yield or purity are compromised.</li>
<li><strong>Reproducibility compromised (1)</strong>: Product obtained
but both yield and purity are severely compromised.</li>
<li><strong>Not reproducible (0)</strong>: No product was obtained.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="grading-of-lab-reports-and-the-emrn-rubric">Grading of lab
reports and the EMRN rubric</h3>
<p>One of the main objectives of this course is for you to learn to
interpret and communicate experimental results. This is a difficult
skill that needs to be developed over time through iteration and
feedback loops. At the end of each module you will submit a formal lab
report, short version for the first two modules, and more extensive for
modules 3-5. Each experiment will end with submission of a written lab
report which will be evaluated using “EMRN” rubric shown below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="EMRN-rubric-2020.png" alt="EMRN rubric" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">EMRN rubric</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each lab report can be revised and resubmitted before the grade
becomes final. Deadlines and conditions for submission of revised
reports will be communicated in Canvas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grade “E” or “M” receives full score (5%)</li>
<li>Grade “R” will receive partial score (3%) with an option to revise
and resubmit.</li>
<li>Grade “N” will receive partial score (2%) with an option to revise
and resubmit but the feedback will be very limited.</li>
<li>No report will not receive credit (0%). Submissions after the
deadline will be reviewed as-is with no possibility for revision and
resubmission.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="research-report-and-presentation">Research report and
presentation</h3>
<p>Written reports and oral presentations will be evaluated using the <a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZAL5_sTpci3waFMQVWRrhFqTF9uOIwv9/view?usp=sharing">ELIPSS
rubric</a>. Enhancing Learning by Improving Process Skills in STEM
(ELIPSS) is an NSF-funded project that focuses on the identification,
development, and assessment of process skills (also known as
professional skills, practical skills, workplace skills, transferable
skills, or soft skills) in active learning, undergraduate STEM
classrooms. Assessing process skill development and providing feedback
to students and instructors is a key component for enhancing these
skills in STEM programs.</p>
