Course Learning Outcomes
------------------------

This course is organized into Modules and aims to help students achieve
learning outcomes through online activities. Each module contains
materials you need to complete the associated activities. Each
course-level student learning outcome is aligned with department-level
learning outcomes which are modeled after the standards set by the
American Chemical Society.

Upon completion of this course students will be able to:

1.  Communicate the structure and properties of organic molecules using
    common drawing and naming conventions
2.  Analyze chemical structures and reaction conditions to make and
    defend predictions about chemical transformations
3.  Use online databases to find relevant research articles containing
    information such as physicochemical properties of organic molecules,
    synthetic procedures, and spectroscopic data.
4.  Use software tools such as ChemDraw to draw chemical structures,
    reactions, and mechanisms
5.  Use software tools such as MestReNova and Topspin to process raw NMR
    data
6.  Plan a synthesis experiment by evaluating the information found in
    online databases and research articles
    <!-- 7. Carry out an experimental procedure to synthesize, isolate, purify, and analyze the product of a chemical reaction (face-to-face course only) -->
7.  Analyze the results of an experiment and be able to identify sources
    of error and suggest improvements;
8.  Interpret spectroscopic data of organic compounds to confirm the
    structure of organic compounds
9.  Communicate the results of experiments to the instructor and peers
    in a written form (lab report)
10. Communicate the results of experiments to the instructor and peers
    in an oral or poster presentation

Department Student Learning Outcomes
------------------------------------

1.  Students will apply their understanding of terminology, concepts,
    theories, and skills to solve problems by defining problems and
    research questions clearly, formulating testable hypotheses,
    designing and conducting experimental tests of hypotheses, analyzing
    and interpreting data, and drawing appropriate conclusions within
    professional ethical guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.1 & 7.6)
2.  Students will demonstrate the ability to conduct laboratory work of
    high quality including handling chemicals and other laboratory
    hazards in a safe, ethical, and socially responsible manner, keeping
    accurate, clear, concise, and complete records of their laboratory
    work in a notebook, properly using standard laboratory equipment and
    instruments, and evaluating the reliability and significance of
    laboratory data, all within professional ethical guidelines. (ACS
    Standards 7.1, 7.3, 7.6)
3.  Students will complete a literature search in one or more of the
    five chemical sub disciplines by using common literature search
    techniques and tools to find recent journal articles from the
    peer-reviewed literature, critically read these articles to extract
    relevant information, and communicate the significance of these
    articles in written or oral formats within professional ethical
    guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.2 & 7.6)
4.  Students will demonstrate the ability to clearly and effectively
    communicate their scientific results and opinions using written
    formats while following professional style and format conventions
    within professional ethical guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.4 & 7.6)
5.  Students will demonstrate the ability to clearly and effectively
    communicate their scientific results and opinions using oral formats
    while following professional style and format conventions within
    professional ethical guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.4 & 7.6)
6.  Students will demonstrate the ability to function effectively in
    collaborative and group work environments including the ability to
    work on a component of a larger project and connect work with
    previous results within professional ethical standards. (ACS
    Standard 7.5 & 7.6)

  --------------------- ----------
  Lab Safety            12%
  Research Tools        8%
  Quizzes & Homework    15%
  Spectroscopy          15%

  TOTAL                 **100%**

Grade brackets are imposed by course coordinator. In the past, the
grading scale followed a pattern close to the following: A = 90--100, B
80--89, C 70--79; D 60--69; and F \<60.

Course policies
===============

Technology issues when submitting work
--------------------------------------

For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility to
make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary, even
if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your
responsibility to find another way to get it to me (for example, via an
email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with
a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline
extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and
Canvas won't accept the file, you should try again later, use a
different browser, or send the file as an email attachment until you can
upload it successfully.

Academic Dishonesty
-------------------

For most assignments you are allowed and encouraged to work with others.
However, the final product that you submit for feedback must be the
result of your own efforts. Therefore you may share ideas and strategies
with others, but collaboration on the actual finished product you submit
is not allowed. Your work is expected to be the product of your own
thinking, written and explained in your own words with no parts of the
work copied from external sources such as books or websites, and done
clearly enough in your own mind that you could explain the work from
start to finish if asked. Specifically, this excludes:

-   copying work from another student;
-   copying work from a website;
-   paraphrasing work done by another student or from print or internet
    resources---i.e.Â putting it in your own words---without coming up
    with the main ideas and strategies yourself; and
-   *allowing or enabling* another student to copy or paraphrase work
    that you did, even if you did the original work yourself.

Violation of this policy is considered "academic dishonesty" and carries
with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State, including
possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the
university. For details, please see APM 235 by going to
<http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf>.

You may feel tempted to academic dishonesty at some point in the
semester. The work can be difficult, and many of you are under a lot of
stress. If you are considering academic dishonesty, please STOP, take a
breath, and remember that your classmates and I want you to succeed in
the course. You are not alone, and you have a strong network in the
class for getting help. The revision and resubmission policies mean that
it's OK to turn in work that isn't perfect. There is no need to be
academically dishonest! Just do your best on the work, and you'll have
the chance to revise it later.

Dropping the course after the census date
-----------------------------------------

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition
that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly
arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings
and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to
and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The
condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student
must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.

Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious
and compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is
dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.

University policies and disclaimers
===================================

In addition to course policies, you are expected to be familiar with
Academic Regulations described in the [University

    3-minute phone call can solve a problem that multiple email
