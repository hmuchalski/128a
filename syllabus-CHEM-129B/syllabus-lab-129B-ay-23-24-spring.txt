## Note about the duration of a lab session `<!-- omit from toc -->`{=html}

The CSU defines *one class hour* as 50 minutes of instruction, which is
the default duration for a 1-unit lecture. Science laboratories fall
under the category of *supervision courses* ([C16
category](https://academics.fresnostate.edu/scheduling/documents/CourseClassificationSystem%201.3.18.pdf)).
For laboratory sessions, 1 unit corresponds to *3 class hours*, totaling
150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of instruction/supervision. This
differs from the duration listed in the catalog (2 hours and 50 minutes)
because it includes a 10-minute break after each 50 minutes of
instruction. However, adhering to fixed time frame in a lab setting is
challenging because work is asynchronous---students work at their own
pace, often in groups. Having fixed times for breaks might be
impractical or unsafe. Consequently, on days when we work without a
break, our goal will be to finish the lab session by 11:30 (3:30 for PM
sections), after 150 minutes of instruction/supervision.

## About the course

The aim of this course is to inspire students to explore the breadth of
organic chemistry, fostering an understanding of its principles and
their practical application. This, in turn, equips students with a
functional knowledge and genuine appreciation of organic structure and
reactivity. In the second semester of the sequence, the emphasis shifts
towards the pivotal role of experimentation in gaining molecular
insights. This involves correlating molecular structure, reactivity, and
function through the use of wet chemical methods and spectroscopy.

CHEM 129B is the second part of the 2-semester sequence in organic
chemistry laboratory. As such it is primarily concerned with introducing
intermediate level concepts and techniques used in organic chemistry. We
will continue to use the techniques covered in the first semester lab
and will introduce additional methods and techniques such as NMR
spectroscopy, multi-step synthesis, green chemistry, and chemical
literature.

### Assumed prior knowledge and skills

The formal pre-requisite to enroll in CHEM 129B is passing CHEM 129A (or
equivalent) with a grade of "C" or better. In practice it means that
students who enroll in CHEM 129B should be able to:

-   communicate the structure and properties of organic molecules using
    common drawing and naming conventions;
-   conduct laboratory work of high quality including handling chemicals
    and other laboratory hazards in a safe, ethical, and socially
    responsible manner;
-   use basic laboratory techniques such as extraction, crystallization,
    filtration, distillation, column chromatography, TLC; and
-   measure melting point and acquire IR spectrum of a sample.

## Course Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

-   Keep accurate, clear, concise, and complete records of their
    laboratory work in a notebook that would allow a trained organic
    chemist to reproduce the results.
-   Describe what you see (macroscopic) with chemical language
    (microscopic & sub-microscopic).
-   Design ways you can separate a mixture into its components by
    manipulating physical and chemical properties.
-   Use standard laboratory equipment and instruments and evaluate the
    reliability and significance of laboratory data, all within
    professional ethical guidelines.
-   Use online databases to find relevant research articles containing
    information such as physical and chemical properties of organic
    molecules, synthetic procedures, and spectroscopic data.
-   Rationalize physical phenomena using polarity and intermolecular
    forces.
-   Plan a synthesis experiment by evaluating the information found in
    online databases and research articles.
-   Carry out an experimental procedure to synthesize, isolate, purify,
    and analyze the product of chemical synthesis.
-   Analyze the results of an experiment and be able to identify sources
    of error and suggest improvements.
-   Interpret spectroscopic data of organic compounds to confirm the
    structure of organic compounds.
-   Communicate the results of experiments to the instructor and peers
    in written form (lab report) and presentation (slide deck or
    poster).

For more details refer to [Department Student Learning
Outcomes](/a5Vq_rZQRI2_f6ylivvNiA) modeled after [ACS Guidelines for
Bachelor's Degree
Programs](https://www.acs.org/education/policies/acs-approval-program/guidelines.html).

## Course materials and technology

-   **Techniques Reference Manual** [LibreTexts e-book by Lisa
    Nichols](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Book:_Organic_Chemistry_Lab_Techniques_(Nichols))
    is our recommended reference for laboratory techniques. The textbook
    by Pavia et al. is listed as the official textbook for this course,
    but we are in the process of phasing it out. If you own a copy of
    Pavia's textbook (5th or 6th edition), then feel free to use it in
    addition to the LibreTexts option
-   **Personal protective equipment (PPE)**: Lab coat and approved
    safety goggles. Disposable nitrile gloves will be provided.
-   **Canvas:** The central repository for all course materials and
    information is our [Canvas
    site](https://fresnostate.instructure.com/courses/76128) which will
    be the main repository for assignments, grades, and links to
    materials/resources.
-   **Document scanning tool**: Most documents you will turn in for
    feedback and grading will be submitted electronically but prepared
    on paper. A smartphone with a scanning app can be used to convert
    paper documents into PDFs. There are number of free options
    available for both iOS and Android. Find one that you like and learn
    how to use it.
-   **Personal computer:** You will need a x86 class personal
    computer[^1] that can run standalone desktop applications. Mobile
    devices can be used but they are inferior or incompatible with
    software we will use.

## Course workflow

Activities in this course follows a cyclical pattern. Over the semester
you will engage in 5 experimental modules and an independent research
project. At the heart of each module is a synthesis of an organic
compound (1--3 steps). Specific requirements will be communicated by the
instructor at the beginning of the semester.

**Before class**, your task will be to prepare for the experiment by
studying the relevant reactions and mechanisms, lab techniques, and
safety information about chemicals you will be work-ing with. Your
instructor may assign graded pre-lab assignment to help you prepare for
the lab.

**Class time** will be focused primarily on doing experiments, making
observations, generating results, processing spectroscopic data, and
group discussions. Results and observations made during lab are
important inputs for writing post-lab reports. For example, not making a
key observation or obtaining poor quality data may reduce your grade on
the experiment because you will not have all information to write the
lab report or discuss the results.

**After class** you will work on finalizing the documentation related to
the experiment, usually in a form of typed lab report. Details for each
post-lab assignment will be posted on Can-vas by the instructor.
Document templates will be available for formal lab reports.

## On keeping records (lab notebook)

The human brain is both the least reliable whiteboard and the least
dependable alarm clock. It's crucial to acknowledge that memories of
your actions and observations in the lab can fade rapidly once you step
away. To counteract this, it's essential to document your experiences in
real time, as these notes (combined with pre-lab documentation) will
serve as the foundation for your subsequent post-lab tasks, such as
reports and presentations.

Maintain a comprehensive record of what you did and observed. Also keep
all physical copies such as IR and NMR spectra, gas chromatograms, and
sketches of TLC plates. These components contribute to your experimental
record. Remember that your lab notes are subject to evaluation at any
point and should remain up-to-date. Your instructor will provide
guidelines on how to maintain your laboratory notebook at the start of
the semester. Be prepared to submit your in-lab notes for assessment
before concluding your time in the lab. your time in the lab.

### Lab notes guiding principles

Lab notes should document what you did and how, what you observed, and
the data you collected. To know what to write and not to write in the
notebook is a balancing act of relevance and brevity. You need write
down details that are relevant and necessary for someone to reproduce
your work. This hypothetical chemist will not be able to consult with
you or have access to any auxiliary documentation that you had access to
while doing the experiment. Therefore, you need to describe what you did
and how.

It is safe to assume, however, that the reader of your notes has been
trained in the basic organic laboratory techniques. For example, you
don't have to explain how to do a recrystallization because the reader
who will should know how to carry out recrystallization (and if not,
they can refer to a techniques manual). What will be helpful to them are
the details relevant to this particular recrystallization: solvent used,
approximate volume of solvent, time it took to cool and grow crystals.

Lab notes should be easy to read---use paragraph breaks, headings, etc.
to help the reader navigate the notebook.

Contrary to common belief, reproducible and detailed lab notes don't
have to be long and take a lot of time and effort to produce. Below is
an example statement that captures all important information about
purification of the crude material, yield, and the appearance of the
final product:

> "The crude product (sticky brown solid, 1.23 g) was recrystallized
> from hot ethanol (15 mL) in an Erlenmeyer flask. After cooling to rt
> and then to 0 °C, the solid was collected by vacuum filtration, washed
> with ice-cold water, and dried in air for 1 h to give the product as a
> white crystalline solid (0.38 g), mp 87--89 °C."

Additional benefit of writing it all down in real time is that it can
help you track down errors, explain unexpected outcomes, and/or
troubleshoot the experiment that went wrong. In the recrystallization
described above, the mass recovery is quite poor and a chemist repeating
the experiment may decide to use less ethanol (or a different solvent)
to improve the mass recovery.

## Assessments and grading

The final grade in the course will be based on your work in three areas
(see table below). There will be four experiment sets, independent
project, and quizzes. Each experiment set will have variety of graded
work (pre-lab, lab notebook, report, and other assignments) that add
contributes to the 15% value for each lab set.

  Assignment Category   %Weight
  --------------------- ----------
  Experiments (4×15)    60%
  Research Project      30%
  Quizzes               10%
  **Total**             **100%**

### Grading philosophy

::: warning
Grading in this course is different than you might be used to. Please
read this section carefully and ask questions as needed.
:::

As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that *learning takes time*
and that grading your work based on a single point of data, such as a
single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps unethical. A
truly valid measure of learning has to involve *multiple attempts* that
allow you to learn from your past mistakes and demonstrate not only your
skill, but also your growth. I believe your work should be evaluated by
just like everyone else's work in the real world is evaluated, i.e., by
giving you *clearly defined standards* for quality, *detailed verbal
feedback* on your work, and *opportunities to try again* based on the
feedback. This gets you into a *feedback loop*, a conversation between
you and me about your work, that continues until your work meets the
standards (or we reach the end of the semester). In light of the
principles outlined above, in this course students can *revise and
resubmit some of their work*, several times over if needed, using the
feedback at each stage to improve and grow.

### Grading of experiments

You will receive feedback and marks on work that you produce in- and
outside the lab. Those include pre-lab documentation, experimental notes
and observations, results (yield, spectroscopic data), and written lab
report. Each of the regular experiments contributes 15% to the final
grade and will have several components (see table below for details).

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Item                                  Value    Revision policy
  ------------------------------------- -------- ------------------------
  Pre-lab documentation                 2%       Before the experiment
                                                 begins

  Risk assessment                       2%       Before the experiment
                                                 begins

  In-lab notes                          3%       No

  Results                               3%       No

  Lab report                            5%       Within one week after
                                                 report returned with
                                                 comments
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Research project

During the second half of the semester, students will engage in an
independent research project known as a CURE (Course-based Undergraduate
Research Experience). The instructor will not provide the project's
objective and methods, and the outcomes are either entirely unknown or
only partially revealed. To accomplish the project, students will
conduct comprehensive literature research to gather the essential
information required for the synthesis. The culmination of this endeavor
will involve delivering a presentation to the class.

### Letter grades

Final grade will be determined based on overall performance according to
the weights in the table above.

  Grade   Total Score
  ------- -------------
  A       90--100%
  B       80--89%
  C       70--79%
  D       60-69%
  F       \<60%

## Safe Chemical Laboratory Practices

1.  NO food or drink in the laboratory.
2.  Wear clothing appropriate for laboratory work.
3.  Select and correctly use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment
    (PPE).
4.  Know what to do and who to contact in an emergency in the
    laboratory.
5.  Avoid distractions and be alert to and aware of your surroundings
    and potential hazards in your area.
6.  Maintain a safe and clean work area.
7.  Only conduct experiments or procedures approved by your lab
    instructor or research advisor.
8.  Understand the common chemical hazards and hazards specific to the
    chemicals and procedures with which you are working.
9.  Understand and follow best practices on how to handle, transport,
    store, and dispose of chemicals safely.
10. If any equipment, glassware, or procedures are not working properly
    or as expected, notify your instructor before proceeding.
11. Notify your instructor if you have, develop, or may develop any
    medical conditions (e.g. severe asthma, limited mobility, vision
    impairment, pregnancy, etc) that may affect your safety in the
    laboratory or sensitivity to chemicals, so that your instructor can
    properly advise or accommodate you on minimizing the risks
    associated with laboratory work.

These principles will be discussed in detail during the first week of
class. More information can be found here: <https://goo.gl/1UFRbo>.
Also, refer to [*Guidelines for Chemical Laboratory Safety in Academic
Institutions*](https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/about/governance/committees/chemicalsafety/publications/acs-safety-guidelines-academic.pdf)
published by American Chemical Society.

## Policies and disclaimers

### Attendance and make-up policy

Students are expected to attend and actively participate in all class
sessions. If you are absent from class, it is your responsibility to
check on announcements made while you were away. The course attendance
policy follows university's [APM 232: Policy on Student
Absence](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf).
Late assignments will not be accepted for a grade unless the absence
meets the guidelines set forth by the university policy. Excuses and
exceptions will be interpreted will in light of the APM 232.

### Technology issues when submitting work

For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility to
make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary, even
if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your
responsibility to find another way to get it to the instructor (for
example, via an email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable
or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid
grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to
upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won't accept the file, you should try
again later or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload
it successfully.

### Academic Dishonesty

For most assignments you are allowed and encouraged to work with others.
However, the final product that you submit for feedback must be the
result of your own efforts. Therefore you may share ideas and strategies
with others, but collaboration on the actual finished product you submit
is not allowed. Your work is expected to be the product of your own
thinking, written and explained in your own words with no parts of the
work copied from external sources such as books or websites, and done
clearly enough in your own mind that you could explain the work from
start to finish if asked. Specifically, this excludes:

-   copying work from another student;
-   copying work from a website;
-   copying work generated by an AI bot such as ChatGPT;
-   paraphrasing work done by another student or from print or Internet
    resources---i.e.,putting it in your own words---without coming up
    with the main ideas and strategies yourself; and
-   *allowing or enabling* another student to copy or paraphrase work
    that you did, even if you did the original work yourself.

Violation of this policy is considered "academic dishonesty" and carries
with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State, including
possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the
university. For details, please see APM 235 by going to
<http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf>.

### Dropping the course after the census date

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition
that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly
arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings
and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to
and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The
condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student
must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.

Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious
and compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is
dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.

### Plagiarism detection

The campus subscribes to Turnitin, a plagiarism prevention service,
through Canvas. You will need to submit written assignments to Turnitin.
Student work will be used for plagiarism detection and for no other
purpose. The student may indicate in writing to the instructor that
he/she refuses to participate in the plagiarism detection process, in
which case the instructor can use other electronic means to verify the
originality of their work. Turnitin Originality Reports WILL NOT be
available for your viewing.

### Intellectual Property

All course materials, including but not limited to the syllabus,
readings, quiz questions, exam questions, and assignments prepared by
the instructor are property of the instructor and University. Students
are prohibited from posting course materials online (e.g., Course Hero)
and from selling course materials to or being paid for providing
materials to any person or commercial firm without the express written
permission of the professor teaching this course. Doing so will
constitute both an academic integrity violation and a copyright
violation. Audio and video recordings of class lectures are prohibited
unless I give you explicit permission in advance. Students with an
official letter from the Services for Students with Disabilities office
may record the class if SSD has approved that service. Otherwise,
recordings of lectures are included in the intellectual property notice
described above.

### Dispute Resolution

If there are questions or concerns that you have about this course that
you and I are not able to resolve, please feel free to contact the Chair
of the department to discuss the matter.

-   Chair's name: Dr. Krish Krishnan
-   Department name: Chemistry and Biochemistry

### Student Ratings of Instruction

In the final weeks of the semester, you will be asked to complete a
short survey to provide feedback about this class. The primary goal of
student ratings is to help your instructor improve the class. Feedback
will also be reviewed by the department chair and the college dean. You
will be given 15 minutes of class time to complete student ratings.
Please offer feedback honestly and thoughtfully. Your participation is
appreciated. You can access your student rating surveys and get more
information at:

## Appendix A: Rubrics

### Lab readiness

-   **Satisfactory (2)**: Prelab documentation (stoichiometry table,
    calculations, etc) is complete, accurate and conveys student's
    readiness to carry out the experiment.
-   **Progressing (1**): Prelab documentation (stoichiometry table,
    calculations, etc) is complete but contains errors or inaccuracies.
    The errors don't compromise student's readiness to carry out the
    experiment.
-   **Incomplete (0**): Prelab documentation was not submitted OR the
    submitted material is incomplete, contains critical errors or
    significant inaccuracies that compromise student's readiness for the
    experiment.

### Risk assessment rubric

-   **Complete (2)**: Hazard and risk assessment is complete, accurate,
    and relevant to the experiment. Significant risks and hazards are
    identified and a safety recommendation is provided. Errors are
    insignificant or inconsequential
-   **Progressing (1)**: Hazard and risk assessment is provided but
    significant gaps remain, the safety information is inaccurate or not
    irrelevant to the experiment.
-   **Incomplete (0)**: Safety information is not provided OR the
    information provided significantly increases the risk of exposure to
    hazards.

### Lab notebook rubric

The notes will allow others to reproduce the work. The notes include
observations and communicate what was done, how, when, and by whom.

-   **Fully reproducible (3)**: The notes are complete and include all
    key information. A person unfamiliar with the experiment is highly
    likely to obtain similar results. Errors are insignificant or
    inconsequential.
-   **Somewhat reproducible (2)**: The notes include most of the
    experimental details needed to repeat the experiment. A person
    unfamiliar with the experiment is somewhat likely to obtain similar
    results.
-   **Reproducibility compromised (1)**: The notes don't include
    necessary information needed to repeat the experiment. Significant
    omissions and errors are present. Even a person familiar with the
    experiment is unlikely to obtain similar results.
-   **Not reproducible (0)**: The copy of lab notes was not submitted,
    the notes are incomplete or not helpful. A person unfamiliar with
    the experiment is very unlikely to obtain similar results.

### Experimental results rubric

-   **Reasonable (3)**: Product obtained with reasonable yield and
    purity.
-   **Somewhat reproducible (2)**: Product obtained but either yield or
    purity are compromised.
-   **Reproducibility compromised (1)**: Product obtained but both yield
    and purity are severely compromised.
-   **Not reproducible (0)**: No product was obtained.

### Grading of lab reports and the EMRN rubric

One of the main objectives of this course is for you to learn to
interpret and communicate experimental results. This is a difficult
skill that needs to be developed over time through iteration and
feedback loops. At the end of each module you will submit a formal lab
report, short version for the first two modules, and more extensive for
modules 3-5. Each experiment will end with submission of a written lab
report which will be evaluated using "EMRN" rubric shown below.

![EMRN rubric](EMRN-rubric-2020.png)

Each lab report can be revised and resubmitted before the grade becomes
final. Deadlines and conditions for submission of revised reports will
be communicated in Canvas.

-   Grade "E" or "M" receives full score (5%)
-   Grade "R" will receive partial score (3%) with an option to revise
    and resubmit.
-   Grade "N" will receive partial score (2%) with an option to revise
    and resubmit but the feedback will be very limited.
-   No report will not receive credit (0%). Submissions after the
    deadline will be reviewed as-is with no possibility for revision and
    resubmission.

### Research report and presentation

Written reports and oral presentations will be evaluated using the
[ELIPSS
rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZAL5_sTpci3waFMQVWRrhFqTF9uOIwv9/view?usp=sharing).
Enhancing Learning by Improving Process Skills in STEM (ELIPSS) is an
NSF-funded project that focuses on the identification, development, and
assessment of process skills (also known as professional skills,
practical skills, workplace skills, transferable skills, or soft skills)
in active learning, undergraduate STEM classrooms. Assessing process
skill development and providing feedback to students and instructors is
a key component for enhancing these skills in STEM programs.

    computers. They can't run ChemDraw or MestReNova software (at least
    not yet).
