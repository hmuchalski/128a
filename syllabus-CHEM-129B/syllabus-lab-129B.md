# What is CHEM 129B

CHEM 129B, Organic Chemistry Laboratory 2, is the second part of the year laboratory sequence in organic chemistry.  As such it is primarily concerned with introducing intermediate level concepts and techniques used in organic chemistry. Although many of the techniques familiar to you from the first semester lab will be used, additional ones will be introduced including NMR, multi-step syntheses, green chemistry, and introduction to the chemical literature and research through project-based experiments.  There will also be more emphasis on problem solving, the application of theory, and structure identification via IR and NMR spectroscopy. 

# Course Learning Outcomes

This course is organized into Modules and aims to help students achieve learning outcomes through online activities. Each module contains materials you need to complete the associated activities. Each course-level student learning outcome is aligned with department-level learning outcomes which are modeled after the standards set by the American Chemical Society.

Upon completion of this course students will be able to:

1. Communicate the structure and properties of organic molecules using common drawing and naming conventions
2. Analyze chemical structures and reaction conditions to make and defend predictions about chemical transformations
3. Use online databases to find relevant research articles containing information such as physical and chemical properties of organic molecules, synthetic procedures, and spectroscopic data.
4. Use software tools such as ChemDraw to draw chemical structures, reactions, and mechanisms
<!-- 5. Use software tools such as MestReNova and Topspin to process raw NMR data -->
5. Plan a synthesis experiment by evaluating the information found in online databases and research articles
<!-- 7. Carry out an experimental procedure to synthesize, isolate, purify, and analyze the product of a chemical reaction (face-to-face course only) -->
6. Analyze the results of an experiment and be able to identify sources of error and suggest improvements;
7. Interpret spectroscopic data of organic compounds to confirm the structure of organic compounds
8. Communicate the results of experiments to the instructor and peers in a written form (lab report)
9. Communicate the results of experiments to the instructor and peers in an oral or poster presentation

# Department Student Learning Outcomes

1. Students will apply their understanding of terminology, concepts, theories, and skills to solve problems by defining problems and research questions clearly, formulating testable hypotheses, designing and conducting experimental tests of hypotheses, analyzing and interpreting data, and drawing appropriate conclusions within professional ethical guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.1 & 7.6)
2. Students will demonstrate the ability to conduct laboratory work of high quality including handling chemicals and other laboratory hazards in a safe, ethical, and socially responsible manner, keeping accurate, clear, concise, and complete records of their laboratory work in a notebook, properly using standard laboratory equipment and instruments, and evaluating the reliability and significance of laboratory data, all within professional ethical guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.1, 7.3, 7.6)
3. Students will complete a literature search in one or more of the five chemical sub disciplines by using common literature search techniques and tools to find recent journal articles from the peer-reviewed literature, critically read these articles to extract relevant information, and communicate the significance of these articles in written or oral formats within professional ethical guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.2 & 7.6)
4. Students will demonstrate the ability to clearly and effectively communicate their scientific results and opinions using written formats while following professional style and format conventions within professional ethical guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.4 & 7.6)
5. Students will demonstrate the ability to clearly and effectively communicate their scientific results and opinions using oral formats while following professional style and format conventions within professional ethical guidelines. (ACS Standards 7.4 & 7.6)
6. Students will demonstrate the ability to function effectively in collaborative and group work environments including the ability to work on a component of a larger project and connect work with previous results within professional ethical standards. (ACS Standard 7.5 & 7.6)

# Virtual classroom policies and statements

## Intellectual Property

As part of your participation in virtual/online instruction, please remember that the same student conduct rules that are used for in-person classrooms instruction also apply for virtual/online classrooms. Students are prohibited from any unauthorized recording, dissemination, or publication of any academic presentation, including any online classroom instruction, for any commercial purpose. In addition, students may not record or use virtual/online instruction in any manner that would violate copyright law. Students are to use all online/virtual instruction exclusively for the educational purpose of the online class in which the instruction is being provided. Students may not re-record any online recordings or post any online recordings on any other format (e.g., electronic, video, social media, audio recording, web page, Internet, hard paper copy, etc.) for any purpose without the explicit written permission of the faculty member providing the instruction. Exceptions for disability-related accommodations will be addressed by Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) working in conjunction with the student and faculty member.

In addition to course policies, you are expected to be familiar with Academic Regulations described in the [University Catalog](http://www.fresnostate.edu/catalog/academic-regulations/) as well as policies listed below.

## Health screening

Students who come to campus for face-to-face classes will be required to complete a daily health screening which will include temperature checks. If you have experienced COVID-19 symptoms and/or have tested positive within the past 10 days; or if you have had close contact (less than 6 feet for longer than 15 minutes while unmasked) with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient within the past 14 days, you are not allowed to come to campus. Please complete the campus [online reporting form][ec7e78cb]. A campus official will reply to provide guidance and information.    

  [ec7e78cb]: https://fresnostate.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3faIAsuC8CzuFjD?Q_FormSessionID=FS_UFJ902LXgDJbKeZ "online reporting form"

## Safety Measures

Consistent with the Governor’s order and updated state public-health guidelines, face masks or cloth face coverings are required to be worn in public spaces on-campus and during in-person classes to reduce possible exposure to COVID-19 and prevent the spread of the virus. Physical distancing must be practiced by maintaining 6 feet of distance between individuals. Good hygiene of hand washing for a minimum of 20 seconds or using hand sanitizer is required. Please avoid touching your face with unclean hands. Disposable face masks will be provided to anyone who arrives to campus without one. Please see university website for the most updated information: [www.fresnostate.edu/coronavirus](http://www.fresnostate.edu/president/coronavirus/index.html)

# Course policies


## Attendance and participation

Students are expected to attend and actively participate in all class sessions. During the Zoom calls, students are expected to engage and collaborate with peers on assigned tasks. Outside of the synchronous class time, students are expected to complete reading assignments (Perusall) to prepare for the class and help the instructor shape the lesson plan.

### Definitions

_Absence_ = Not attending the zoom meeting or more than 15 min late to the zoom meeting. 

### Consequences

- 1 Absence: Notification and a reminder about the attendance policy
- 2 Absences: 1-on-1 zoom meeting with the instructor
- 3 Absences: 3% reduction of the final grade; and 
- 1% reduction for each additional absence

Excuses and exceptions will be interpreted by following university's [APM 232: Policy on Student Absence](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf). 

## Late work/make-up policy

It is important that you understand my homework policy. I don't want to weigh the different reasons students had for turning in late work using my own social filters because it is unfair. As adult learners, sometimes we must pay more attention to our lives than our schoolwork. That’s OK; I don’t think students who do that are bad students. If the grade is important to you, somehow you will find a way to get the stuff turned in on time. No single missed weekly assignment will cause you to fail this class. 

I understand that life gets in the way. I also strongly believe in revision and refinement of academic work and have developed the following late work policy: 

1. Homework assignments are due on Sunday at 11:59 pm and at 12:00 am (Monday) a 5-day grace period begins. 
2. Assignments received by the Sunday deadline will be graded first and returned as soon as possible. During the grace period you can revise/resubmit returned assignments[^assessable] based on the feedback. 
3. During the grace period you can still turn in the assignment without penalty, no questions asked, but it will not be graded in time for you to revise/resubmit based on the feedback. 
4. Revision and resubmission is not available for assignments that aim to prepare you for the class meeting: pre-lab assignments and Perusall reading assignments. Those deadlines are final. 
5. Assignments received after the grace period will not be accepted for a grade unless the reason meets the guidelines set forth by the university policy [APM 232: Policy on Student Absence](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf)

[^assessable]: The assignment needs to be complete in order to qualify for the revision and resubmission. In other words, an incomplete assignment submitted just to meet the deadline will not be allowed to be revised/resubmitted. In such case, it is better to complete the assignment and turn it in within the 5-day grace period.

## Technology issues when submitting work

For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility to make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary, even if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your responsibility to find another way to get it to the instructor (for example, via an email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try again later or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.

## Respondus Lockdown Browser

Respondus Lockdown Browser is a custom browser that locks down the testing environment within Canvas. When students use the Respondus Lockdown Browser they are unable to print, copy, go to a URL, or access other applications. When an assessment is started, students are locked into it until they submit it for grading. Available for both Windows and Mac. Respondus Lockdown Browser does not work on a Chromebook.

Respondus Lockdown Browser uses a standard Windows or Mac installer that can be downloaded by faculty or students from the following link (note: this link is unique for Fresno State):

[http://www.respondus.com/lockdown/download.php?id=749643058](http://www.respondus.com/lockdown/download.php?id=749643058)

## Academic Dishonesty

For most assignments you are allowed and encouraged to work with others. However, the final product that you submit for feedback must be the result of your own efforts. Therefore you may share ideas and strategies with others, but collaboration on the actual finished product you submit is not allowed. Your work is expected to be the product of your own thinking, written and explained in your own words with no parts of the work copied from external sources such as books or websites, and done clearly enough in your own mind that you could explain the work from start to finish if asked. Specifically, this excludes:

- copying work from another student;
- copying work from a website;
- paraphrasing work done by another student or from print or Internet resources---i.e. putting it in your own words---without coming up with the main ideas and strategies yourself; and
- *allowing or enabling* another student to copy or paraphrase work that you did, even if you did the original work yourself.

Violation of this policy is considered “academic dishonesty” and carries with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State, including possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the university. For details, please see APM 235 by going to [http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf](http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf).

You may feel tempted to academic dishonesty at some point in the semester. The work can be difficult, and many of you are under a lot of stress. If you are considering academic dishonesty, please STOP, take a breath, and remember that your classmates and I want you to succeed in the course. You are not alone, and you have a strong network in the class for getting help. The revision and resubmission policies mean that it’s OK to turn in work that isn’t perfect. There is no need to be academically dishonest! Just do your best on the work, and you'll have the chance to revise it later.

## Dropping the course after the census date

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.

Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious and compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.
