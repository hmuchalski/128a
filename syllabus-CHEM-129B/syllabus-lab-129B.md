## About the course

CHEM 129B is the second part of the year laboratory sequence in organic chemistry. As such it is primarily concerned with introducing intermediate level concepts and techniques used in organic chemistry. Although many of the techniques familiar to you from the first semester lab will be used, additional ones will be introduced including NMR, multi-step syntheses, green chemistry, and introduction to the chemical literature and research through project-based experiments.  There will also be more emphasis on problem solving, the application of theory, and structure identification via IR and NMR spectroscopy. 

### Course goal

The goal of this course is to drive the student to appreciate the breadth of organic chemistry by facilitating an understanding of the principles, and the practice of applying them, to gain a working knowledge and appreciation of organic structure and reactivity. The second semester in the sequence also emphesizes that our only way to molecular knowledge is through experimentation; correlating structure with reactivity and function through wet chemical methods, spectroscopy, and use of computational simulations.

### Assumed prior knowledge and skills

Students who enroll in CHEM 129B should be able to:

* communicate the structure and properties of organic molecules using common drawing and naming conventions;
* use fundamental laboratory techniques such as extraction, crystallization, distillation, chromatography
* measure physical properties of organic compounds including melting and boiling points
* demonstrate the ability to conduct laboratory work of high quality including handling chemicals and other laboratory hazards in a safe, ethical, and socially responsible manner


### Course Learning Outcomes

Course-level student learning outcome is aligned with department-level learning outcomes which are modeled after the standards set by the American Chemical Society. 

Upon completion of this course students will be able to:

* Keep accurate, clear, concise, and complete records of their laboratory work in a notebook that would allow a trained organic chemist to reproduce the results.
* Use standard laboratory equipment and instruments, and evaluate the reliability and significance of laboratory data, all within professional ethical guidelines.
* Use online databases to find relevant research articles containing information such as physical and chemical properties of organic molecules, synthetic procedures, and spectroscopic data.
* Plan a synthesis experiment by evaluating the information found in online databases and research articles
* Carry out an experimental procedure to synthesize, isolate, purify, and analyze the product of chemical synthesis
* Analyze the results of an experiment and be able to identify sources of error and suggest improvements;
* Interpret spectroscopic data of organic compounds to confirm the structure of organic compounds
* Communicate the results of experiments to the instructor and peers in a written form (lab report) and presentation (slide deck or poster).


### Course materials and technology

- **Techniques Reference Manual** Experiments in this course is based on the textbook titled "Micro-scale Approach to Organic Laboratory Techniques" by Pavia et al. This title is still listed as the official required course textbook, but we are in the process of phasing it out. Check Canvas for complete information about the textbook.
- **Personal protective equipment (PPE)**: Lab coat and approved safety goggles. Disposable nitrile gloves will be provided.
- **Canvas:** The central repository for all course materials and information is our Canvas site, accessible through [INSERT LINK](https://). The Canvas site will house assignments, grades, and links to materials/resources.
- **Personal computer:** You will need a x86 class personal computer that can run standalone desktop applications. Mobile devices can be used but they are inferior or incompatible with software we will use.
- **Zoom:** Virtual meetings (if any) will be held via Zoom. Links and passwords to zoom meetings will be published on Canvas.
- **Document scanning tool**: Many assignments in this course are designed to be prepared by hand on paper. Few people own document scanners nowadays, but a mobile device with a scanning app can do a sufficient job at converting paper documents into PDFs. There are number of options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that you like and learn how to use it.
- **Office 365 Apps**: Many assignments in this course are submitted as Word documents and are based on templates that are Word documents. Office 365 apps are available for Fresno State students. The suite includes the scanning app _Office Lens_. [Learn more](https://help.fresnostate.edu/students/software/office365.php).


## Course workflow

**Before class**, your task will be to review previously covered material and for the upcoming lab by reading the assigned material, preparing the pre-experiment documentation, reviewing the relevant lab techniques, and reviewing the safety information about chemicals you will be working with.

**Class time** will be spent on carrying out experiments, making observations, generating results, and discussions. Although results and observations are not graded directly, they are important components of lab reports. For example, not making a key observation or obtaining poor quality data may reduce your grade on the experiment.

**After class** you will work on finalizing the documentation related to the experiment usually in a form of typed lab report. Details for each post-lab assignment will be posted on Canvas. Document templates will be available for formal lab reports.

:::info
**Keeping records**. Assume that you're in note-taking mode at all time when you are in the lab. Well prepared pre-lab and in-lab notes are very important because they are the basis for the post-lab summary or report that you will be asked to complete.

In-lab notes document what you did in the lab (including notes taken during lecture and discussions) and the results of your experimental work. To know what to write and not to write in the notebook is a balancing act of relevance and brevity. You need write down details that are relevant and necessary for you (for someone else) to reproduce the experiment. Assume that your notes are going to be read by a trained organic chemist. For example, you don't have to explain what is a round-bottomed flask but you should mention the size of flask, joint size, etc.

Keep all prints (IR and NMR spectra, gas chromatograms, etc.) and sketches of TLC plates as part of experimental record. Your lab notebook is subject to evaluation at any time and must be kept current. Instructions on how to keep laboratory notebook are discussed in the textbook and will be reviewed in the lab. You will submit your in-lab notes for review before you leave the lab room.

## Learning activities, assessments, and grades

The main "unit" that divides the content of the course is an experiment. Each experiment will have several learning activities. You will be in the lab for several hours, but there will also be work assigned outside of lab time. Graded work that you produce in- and outside the lab include prelab documentation, experimental notes, chemical product, and a written lab report. There will also be quizzes, homework problems, as well as presentation of the assigned independent project.

Graded assignments are organized into assignment groups and each group contributes to the final grade. Point values used to score assignments in different categories are not equivalent and should not be treated as such. For example, it may take more work and effort to earn 50 points for a report than 100 points for completing a homework problem. 

| Assignment Category       | %Weight  |  
| ------------------------- | -------- |  
| Experiments (10% each)    | 50%      |  
| Quizzes                   | 20%      |  
| Independent Project       | 20%      |  
| Misc (homework, problems) | 10%      |  
| **Total**                 | **100%** |  

### Grading philosophy

:::warning
Grading in this course is different than you might be used to. Please read this section carefully and ask questions as needed. 
:::

As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that *learning takes time* and that grading your work based on a single point of data, such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps unethical. A truly valid measure of learning has to involve *multiple attempts* that allow you to learn from your past mistakes and demonstrate not only your skill, but also your growth. I believe your work should be evaluated by just like everyone else's work in the real world is evaluated, i.e., by giving you *clearly defined standards* for quality, *detailed verbal feedback* on your work, and *opportunities to try again* based on the feedback. This gets you into a *feedback loop*, a conversation between you and me about your work, that continues until your work meets the standards (or we reach the end of the semester). In light of the principles outlined above, in this course students can *revise and resubmit some of their work*, several times over if needed, using the feedback at each stage to improve and grow.

### Grading of experiments

Graded work that you produce in- and outside the lab include prelab documentation, experimental notes and observations, results (yield, spectroscopic data) and a written lab report. Each experiment contributes 10% to the final grade and will have several components (see table below for details). 

| Item                    | Value | Can be revised? |  
| ----------------------- | ----- | --------------- |  
| Pre-lab documentation   | 2%    | Yes             |  
| In-lab notes            | 1%    | No              |  
| Results (yield & purity)| 1%    | No              |  
| Lab report              | 6%    | Yes             |  

Pre-lab documentation, results, and notes and will be graded either as *satisfactory* or *unsatisfactory*. For chemical samples (results), *satisfactory* typically means that evidence a product of reasonable yield and purity was submitted by the due date. For notes, *satisfactory* means that the experiment can be reproduced by a trained organic chemist using only the information in the notebook. 

### Grading of lab reports and the EMRN rubric

One of the main objectives of this course is for you to learn to interpret and communicate experimental results. The lab report is the assignment that shows your level of understanding of the concepts, techniques, and instrumentation used in the lab. Each experiment will end with submission of a written lab report which will be evaluated using "EMRN" rubric shown below. 

![EMPX rubric](http://rtalbert.org/content/images/2022/04/EMRN-rubric-2020.png)

Each lab report can be revised and resubmitted before the grade becomes final. Deadlines and conditions for submission of revised reports will be communicated in Canvas.

- grade "E" or "M" receives full credit (8%),
- grade "R" will receive half of the credit (4%) with an option to revise and resubmit,
- grade "N" will receive quarter of the credit (2%) with an option to revise and resubmit
- no report will not receive credit.

### Independent project

### Assingment of letter grades

Final grade will be determined based on overall performance according to the weights in the table above.

| Grade | Total Score |  
| ----- | ----------- |  
| A     | 90--100%    |  
| B     | 80--89%     |  
| C     | 70--79%     |  
| D     | 60-69%      |  
| F     | <60%        |  


## Laboratory Code of Safe Practices

1. NO food or drink in the laboratory.
2. Wear clothing appropriate for laboratory work.
3. Select and correctly use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
4. Know what to do and who to contact in an emergency in the laboratory.
5. Avoid distractions and be alert to and aware of your surroundings and potential hazards in your area.
6. Maintain a safe and clean work area.
7. Only conduct experiments or procedures approved by your lab instructor or research advisor.
8. Understand the common chemical hazards and hazards specific to the chemicals and procedures with which you are working.
9. Understand and follow best practices on how to handle, transport, store, and dispose of chemicals safely.
10. If any equipment, glassware, or procedures are not working properly or as expected, notify your instructor before proceeding.
11. Notify your instructor if you have, develop, or may develop any medical conditions (e.g. severe asthma, limited mobility, vision impairment, pregnancy, etc) that may affect your safety in the laboratory or sensitivity to chemicals, so that your instructor can properly advise or accommodate you on minimizing the risks associated with laboratory work.

These principles will be discussed in detail during the first week of class. More information can be found here: [https://goo.gl/1UFRbo](https://goo.gl/1UFRbo). Also, refer to [_Guidelines for Chemical Laboratory Safety in Academic Institutions_](https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/about/governance/committees/chemicalsafety/publications/acs-safety-guidelines-academic.pdf) published by American Chemical Society.


# Policies and disclaimers

## Attendance and participation

Students are expected to attend and actively participate in all class sessions. During the Zoom calls, students are expected to engage and collaborate with peers on assigned tasks. Outside of the synchronous class time, students are expected to complete reading assignments (Perusall) to prepare for the class and help the instructor shape the lesson plan.

Excuses and exceptions will be interpreted by following university's [APM 232: Policy on Student Absence](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf). 

## Late work/make-up policy

It is important that you understand my homework policy. I don't want to weigh the different reasons students had for turning in late work using my own social filters because it is unfair. As adult learners, sometimes we must pay more attention to our lives than our schoolwork. That’s OK; I don’t think students who do that are bad students. If the grade is important to you, somehow you will find a way to get the stuff turned in on time. No single missed weekly assignment will cause you to fail this class. 

I understand that life gets in the way. I also strongly believe in revision and refinement of academic work and have developed the following late work policy: 

1. Homework assignments are due on Sunday at 11:59 pm and at 12:00 am (Monday) a 5-day grace period begins. 
2. Assignments received by the Sunday deadline will be graded first and returned as soon as possible. During the grace period you can revise/resubmit returned assignments[^assessable] based on the feedback. 
3. During the grace period you can still turn in the assignment without penalty, no questions asked, but it will not be graded in time for you to revise/resubmit based on the feedback. 
4. Revision and resubmission is not available for assignments that aim to prepare you for the class meeting: pre-lab assignments and Perusall reading assignments. Those deadlines are final. 
5. Assignments received after the grace period will not be accepted for a grade unless the reason meets the guidelines set forth by the university policy [APM 232: Policy on Student Absence](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/232.pdf)

[^assessable]: The assignment needs to be complete in order to qualify for the revision and resubmission. In other words, an incomplete assignment submitted just to meet the deadline will not be allowed to be revised/resubmitted. In such case, it is better to complete the assignment and turn it in within the 5-day grace period.

## Technology issues when submitting work

For assignments submitted electronically, it is your responsibility to make sure they are submitted on time, through any means necessary, even if technology issues arise. If a tech issue arises, it is your responsibility to find another way to get it to the instructor (for example, via an email attachment). Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try again later or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.

## Academic Dishonesty

For most assignments you are allowed and encouraged to work with others. However, the final product that you submit for feedback must be the result of your own efforts. Therefore you may share ideas and strategies with others, but collaboration on the actual finished product you submit is not allowed. Your work is expected to be the product of your own thinking, written and explained in your own words with no parts of the work copied from external sources such as books or websites, and done clearly enough in your own mind that you could explain the work from start to finish if asked. Specifically, this excludes:

- copying work from another student;
- copying work from a website;
- paraphrasing work done by another student or from print or Internet resources---i.e. putting it in your own words---without coming up with the main ideas and strategies yourself; and
- *allowing or enabling* another student to copy or paraphrase work that you did, even if you did the original work yourself.

Violation of this policy is considered “academic dishonesty” and carries with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State, including possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the university. For details, please see APM 235 by going to [http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf](http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf).

You may feel tempted to academic dishonesty at some point in the semester. The work can be difficult, and many of you are under a lot of stress. If you are considering academic dishonesty, please STOP, take a breath, and remember that your classmates and I want you to succeed in the course. You are not alone, and you have a strong network in the class for getting help. The revision and resubmission policies mean that it’s OK to turn in work that isn’t perfect. There is no need to be academically dishonest! Just do your best on the work, and you'll have the chance to revise it later.

## Dropping the course after the census date

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition.

Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious and compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.

## University policies and disclaimers

**Students with Disabilities**: Upon identifying themselves to the instructor and the university, students with disabilities will receive reasonable accommodation for learning and evaluation.
